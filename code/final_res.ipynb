The move would see the Socialist Party (PSOE) lose power in the Junta, as the regional government is known, for the first time in 36 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Talks in Andalusia have been ongoing since regional polls were held on December 2. The PSOE, led by incumbent premier Susana Díaz, had been expected to win the early elections, but in a shock result the party took the most seats in parliament, 33, but fell well short of a majority of 55. It was their worst result in the region since Spain returned to democracy. The PP came in second, with 26 seats, while Ciudadanos were third with 21. The major surprise was the strong performance of far-right group Vox, which won more than 391,000 votes (10.9%), giving it 12 deputies. The anti-immigration group is the first of its kind to win seats in a Spanish parliament since the end of the Francisco Franco dictatorship. It now holds the key to power in Andalusia, given that its votes, added to those of the PP and Ciudadanos, constitute an absolute majority.\n",

    "On Thursday, Marta Bosquet of Ciudadanos was voted in as the new speaker of the Andalusian parliament thanks to 59 votes from her party, the PP and Vox. The other candidate, Inmaculada Nieto of Adelante Andalucía, secured 50 votes – from her own party and 33 from the PSOE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker’s role in the parliament is key for the calling of an investiture vote and for the selection of the candidate for premier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Officially, the talks as to the make up of a future government have yet to start, but in reality they are well advanced, according to sources from both the PP and Ciudadanos. The leader of the Andalusian PP is banking on being voted into power around January 16 and wants the majority of his Cabinet to be decided “five days before the investiture vote.”\n",

    "\n",
    "The PP, which was ousted from power by the PSOE in the national government in June, is keen to take the reins of power in Andalusia as soon as possible. The difficulties that Ciudadanos has faced to justify the necessary inclusion of Vox in the talks, has slowed down progress. Rather than align itself with the far right party, the group – which began life in Catalonia in response to the independence drive, but soon launched onto the national stage – had sought a deal with Adelante Andalucía.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wednesday was a day of intense talks among the parties in a bid to find a solution that would keep everyone happy. But at 9pm last night, Adelante Andalucía announced that it would not be part of “any deal” and that would instead vote for its own candidates to the speaker’s committee in order to “face up to the right wing and the extreme right.”\n",
    "\n",

    "Vodafone España has informed representatives of its employees that it is putting a collective dismissal plan into action that will affect a maximum of 1,200 workers, 24% of its total workforce in Spain of 5,000 people. The layoffs, news of which was broken by EL PAÍS in November, have been justified by the telecoms giant due to the obligation to reduce costs due to a fall in earnings caused by a continuous reduction of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In the current market climate, demand for services continues to grow exponentially, but this is not the case with prices,” the company stated in a press release. “Nearly 50% of net new customers are associated with low- or medium-cost offers, something that obliges Vodafone to have a cost structure that is prepared to successfully compete in all segments.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Vodafone added that the current expectations of clients, “who demand an agile, simple and immediate relationship [with their operator],” is prompting the firm to seek “a more simplified organizational model that strengthens coordination and synergies between teams.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the company continued, it is looking to “reverse the negative trend of the business, strengthen sustainability, protect our capacity to invest and design a more competitive organization that adapts better to what our customers are asking for.”\n",

    "The operator says that it is sure it can reach a deal with labor unions so that the measures are as painless as possible. The redundancies will likely take effect at the end of February or the beginning of March.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vodafone has suffered a great deal in the trade war that was sparked by its rivals Movistar and Orange, after the company opted not to buy the rights for Champions League or La Liga soccer matches on the basis of low returns. The strategy has prompted an exodus of clients from their broadband internet, mobile and pay-TV services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first three quarters of 2018, Vodafone has lost 361,000 cellphone lines (70,000 of which were contracts), 134,000 broadband customers, and 108,000 pay-TV subscriptions. The operator has only seen positive numbers in fiber optic internet, where it has put on 84,000 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator executed a similar collective dismissal plan (known in Spanish as an ERE) in 2015, reaching a deal with the main labor unions UGT and STC, and which meant the firing of 1,509 workers – 238 fewer than those initially proposed by the company. Vodafone justified those sackings based on the duplication of roles caused by the purchase of rival operator ONO in 2014, and the absorption of the company’s workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the acquisition of ONO, Vodafone also executed an ERE in 2013. On that occasion, the company agreed with unions on the firing of 620 employees, the externalization of services, which affected 130 workers, and changes in the conditions of another 150 people.\n",

    "But the feeling in Argentina has been less optimistic. The national newspaper La Nación wrote that “it represents, in some way, the structural failure of our soccer, which is unable to organize the best final in the history of the [Copa] Libertadores.” Online sports daily Ole agreed: “The final in Madrid is a punch in the soul to all fans of soccer in Argentina. Ten thousands kilometers away, River-Boca is an unhappy attempt to transform the classic into a Champions League event.” According to a survey run by Ole, 76% of respondents think it is bad that the game has been moved to Spain.\n",

According to sources familiar with the security operations, between four and six weeks are needed to analyze the security needs of high-risk sporting stadiums and the ensuing preparations can take up to eight months. In the case of the Copa Libertadores final, security officials will have just days to prepare.\n",

    "The obesity epidemic has been on the rise for years, with cases nearly tripling since 1975, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And the outlook for the future is equally bleak – and that includes Spain, a country that is famed for the positive effects of its supposedly Mediterranean diet.\n",

    "An investigation by the Mar de Barcelona hospital has found that 80% of men and 55% of women will be overweight by 2030. If the current trend continues, the researchers write, within 11 years more than 27 million people in Spain will be overweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being overweight can mean a higher risk of suffering a number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "The study, published in the Spanish Cardiology Magazine, points out that this epidemic will mean costs of €3 billion for the country’s health system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue, the experts state, is not an esthetic one, but rather a question of health. Being overweight can mean a higher risk of suffering a number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer and other cardiovascular conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers at the Barcelona hospital revised all of the scientific literature published in Spain on epidemiology and the prevalence of obesity and excess weight between 1987 and 2014 in order to come up with an accurate picture of the state of the country’s residents. “We found the trends and we cross-referenced them with data covering the general population from the National Statistics Institute in order to estimate the figures of obesity and excess weight,” explains Álvaro Hernáez, the chief researcher on the project. The results revealed an “alarming future.”\n",

    "“There are currently 25 million people with excess weight, three million more than a decade ago,” explains Dr Albert Goday, another author of the study. “In a conservative scenario, if this trend continues, there will be another three million more – 16% more cases – by 2030.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“In men, excess weight is more usual up to the age of 50,” explains Goday. “From 50 onward, obesity rises among women. These are issues that are intrinsically linked to hormonal metabolism. From a certain age, it is harder for women to control their weight.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The experts argue that any weight loss, no matter how small, reduces the risk of contracting one of the associated illnesses. “We aren’t going to find the key to this or a vaccination overnight,” Goday adds. “But any minor intervention will help to reduce the risk. You might think that you have made a huge effort and have only lost four kilos when you need to lose many more, but you must bear in mind that those four kilos are already reducing the risk.”\n",
