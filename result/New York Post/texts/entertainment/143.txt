The idea of listening to some off-key chords may not seem ideal. But, contrary to popular belief, most parents actually want their kids to learn a musical instrument.
A new study conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Guitar Center surveyed 2,000 Americans about their musical choices for their children –with some surprising results.
The survey found that 82% of parents think it’s important that their child learn to play an instrument — although the recorder was not their No. 1 pick. 
The instrument 18% of parents most want to hear being practiced in their home is the piano. 
However, the surprising No. 2 pick, according to 17% of respondents, is — drumroll, please — the dulcet tones of the drum, followed closely by the violin (16%).
That’s right: one in six parents want their children to learn to play drums.
As far as what the children themselves want, it’s a potentially bombastic choice: The top instrument is the electric guitar, according to 22% of the parents polled.
More than half — 1,200 — of the parents surveyed said they have played at least one instrument in their lifetime.
The survey revealed one of every four Americans can play an instrument — with 17% picking up old musical habits during the coronavirus pandemic and 37% saying they’d learned an instrument in the past but don’t currently play anything.
A quarter of respondents said they have never learned an instrument and only 9% of parents said their children hadn’t yet expressed any interest in learning an instrument.
In addition, 26% believe that music education should be encouraged in schools, and 29% think it should be required or prioritized at school.
