She doesn’t need this kind of exposure.
Supermodel Emily Ratajkowski is being sued by a photographer for copyright infringement after she allegedly posted two paparazzi photos of herself on her Instagram account without the shutterbug’s permission, a complaint says.
Queens photographer Edward Opinaldo said he took the snaps of the 31-year-old stunner — dressed in a stylish Adeam fuchsia pantsuit — leaving a Big Apple building on June 17, 2019. The “Love Somebody” video star posted two of the shots to her Instagram page that same day and garnered 288,000 likes, the Manhattan federal court filing says. 
Opinaldo had his shots copyrighted in July 2019. He first noticed the snaps on Ratajkowski’s Instagram story in September 2019, according to the seven-page filing.
Opinaldo’s original photo and a screengrab of the same photo from the model’s Instagram are listed as exhibits in the federal court filing.
The suit seeks unspecified damages.
Ratajkowski, a mega-influencer who currently has 29.4 million Instagram followers, was sued for copyright infringement by a different photographer in October 2019.
Manhattan lensman Robert O’Neil alleged the 5-foot-7 London-born model/actress — whose net worth is $8 million — shared his picture of her walking down a New York City street with a bouquet of flowers, PageSix reported.
The case was settled out of court in April.
Said Ratajkowski attorney Ellie Heisler of the latest litigation: “Emily was sued for copyright infringement previously and the plaintiff conceded that Emily did not infringe any copyright. … We are confident that Emily will have similar success in defending this lawsuit as well.”
The model-actress added author to her resume last November with the release of a book of essays, “My Body” in which, Ratajkowski writes about the price of beauty and how adults sexualized her at a young age.
