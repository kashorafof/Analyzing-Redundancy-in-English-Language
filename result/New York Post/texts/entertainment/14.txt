A Caterpillar employee was killed in an accident at the company’s foundry in Mapleton, Illinois, last week, the company has confirmed.
“We are deeply saddened by the death of an employee who was involved in a serious incident at our Mapleton, Illinois, facility on June 2,” Lisa Miller, a Caterpillar spokeswoman, said in an email to the Peoria Journal Star. “Our thoughts are with this employee’s family, friends and colleagues. The safety of our employees, contractors and visitors is our top priority.”
The Journal Star reported that the deceased was Steven Dierkes, 39, who died after falling into a crucible. 
Coroner Jamie Harwood told the outlet Dierkes was killed instantly, and that no foul play is suspected in the tragic incident. Harwood said that the local sheriff’s office and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are both investigating.
In late December 2021, a 50-year-old man fell to his death at the Caterpillar facility. He was working on-site for a local contractor, according to the Peoria County Sheriff’s Office.
The foundry in Mapleton is one of the largest in the U.S. and “can melt up to 1,000 tons of iron each day,” according to Caterpillar’s website. 
Caterpillar Inc. did not respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.
