Want a smart idea for summer? 
Samsung has a few in store, with their Discover Samsung Summer event going on now. They are offering tons of deals on Smart TV bundles and other devices for the home, including laptops, appliances and more. 
Now through June 26, save big with stand-alone deals, like $100 off the Samsung Jet 75 Cordless Stick Vacuum and up to $1,000 off the 75″ Class Q70A QLED 4K Smart TV to name a few. 
You can also get in on bundled savings, with buy more, save more style sales across the site on smartwatches, TV’s and more. 
Speaking of those, if you’ve been looking to turn your home into an art gallery that doubles as a theatre, the coveted Samsung Frame TV is on sale with a buy more, save more style promotion. Those who buy two or more select Frame models can take 10% off their purchase. 
There is plenty more to shop that we haven’t listed yet, like the Galaxy S22 and Freestyle Projector to name a few hot devices for summer. We advise you to take a look for yourself before June 26 to shop the full sale, stocking up for a belated Father’s Day gift, projectors and sound bars for a Fourth of July party and maybe even a back-to-school laptop for the fall.
