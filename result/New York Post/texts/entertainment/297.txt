The lights of broadway shone brightly during the 2022 Tony Awards on Sunday as members of the Broadway community gathered at Radio City Music Hall to celebrate Broadway’s return after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hosted by Academy Award winner and Tony nominee Ariana DeBose, the night was full of performances by the musicals that made up the night’s best musical category.
Viewers were also treated to a reunion of the 2007 cast of Duncan Sheik’s “Spring Awakening” as well as a moving tribute to the late Stephen Sondheim, who died in November at 91.
DeBose, 31, opened the show with a mash-up of some of Broadway’s greatest hits including the likes of “Cabaret,” “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Evita,” “The Wiz,” “Chicago,” “Hamilton,” — which included a shoutout to Lin-Manuel Miranda — “Rent” and “Hairspray.”
Now THAT is how you kick off the #TonyAwards! 👏 We give our round of applause right back to @ArianaDeBose. pic.twitter.com/fybuEJ0agQ
