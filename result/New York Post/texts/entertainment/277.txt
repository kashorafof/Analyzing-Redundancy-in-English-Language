Kim Kardashian has so much love for sister Khloé Kardashian.
So much so that the 41-year-old reality-TV personality enlarged the crotch area for her SKIMS bodysuits — especially for her younger sibling.
Khloé, 37, has been outspoken about the shapewear suits needing to have larger areas down under and Kimmie delivered.
Kim took to her Instagram Stories earlier this week to reveal that she spoke with her SKIMS team to redesign her bodysuits.
“@khloekardashian it’s your lucky day,” the mother of four wrote on a video clip.
“I’m in a @skims design meeting and we’re going to widen the shapewear bodysuit vagina area just for you,” she added.
The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star then included the hashtag #TheKhloeKut in her post. 
She continued in a voiceover: “Khloé, you would be so proud. I’m in a full SKIMS shapewear meeting and guys, we are making the vagina part in the bodysuit thicker – wider, sorry.” 
“We’re changing a few things for all of the comments and questions that you guys have been asking for for a really long time,” Kim said.
She then took a snapshot of the crotch area of one of her shapewear suits and stated: “Just for you, Khlo, widening it.”
The “Revenge Body” star previously discussed the tight-fitting garments on an episode of Hulu’s “The Kardashians.”
Khloé commented that while she was wearing an “amazing” SKIMS bodysuit, she claimed that the crotch area is secured with just a “sliver” of fabric and asked her sissy if it was supposed to only cover her “cl – t.”
“The vagina needs a little more fabric, just a little wider, and for all you little bitches, why does it matter?” she wondered.
