Tiger Woods’ recovery from a gruesome leg injury — one that prompted doctors to consider amputation — this year seems more impressive considering a recently released photo of the legendary golfer.
Woods, 46, — who played in the Masters and PGA Championship, but skipped the U.S. Open — attended a junior golf event over the weekend to watch his son, Charlie.
Look at Tiger Woods’ right leg in this recent photo – incredible that he can play at all, much less competitively. @willbardwell @AlanShipnuck @firepitstories pic.twitter.com/oOa7fKZfOY
While at the event, he posed for pictures with several younger golfers; he did so without the black leg sleeve that usually covers his right leg.
The photo clearly shows the extensive scarring on Woods’ leg, blemishes from the single-car wreck that knocked him unconscious in February 2021. 
Fans and golfers alike expressed their amazement at Wood’s rehabilitation efforts amid the revealing photo.
“Now many people will give him the props he deserves for walking around Augusta and playing as well as he did this year,” PGA Tour pro Dylan Fritelli said, referencing Woods’ ability to play at this year’s Masters.
Woods, a 15-time major winner, decided to miss this past weekend’s U.S. Open, instead opting to rest in anticipation of playing in the 150th Open, slated for July 14-17 at St. Andrew’s, a legendary — and flatter — golf course.
