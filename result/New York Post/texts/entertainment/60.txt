Apple TV+ dropped the trailer for one of late actor Ray Liotta’s final roles.
The six-episode drama “Black Bird” streams on the platform July 8. The miniseries follows the son of a police officer, Jimmy Keene (Taron Egerton), who is sentenced to serve 10 years in a minimum-security prison. But he has a choice: he can stay or transfer to a maximum-security facility and befriend a suspected serial killer (Paul Walter Hauser) in hopes of getting him to confess to more crimes.
Liotta, who plays Keene’s dad, is seen at the start of the trailer. “I never wanted this for you,” he says. “I wanted a totally different life — a steady paycheck, kids, a family.”
Last month, “Black Bird” creator Dennis Lehane wrote a tribute to Liotta, saying working with the actor was a “culmination of a lifelong dream.”
Lehane also said he penned Liotta’s role with the actor in mind and was “humbled, honored, fist-pump elated” when he quickly signed on to the project.
The 67-year-old “Goodfellas” alum died last month in his sleep while filming the movie “Dangerous Waters” in the Dominican Republic.
“Goodfellas” director Martin Scorsese was “absolutely shocked and devastated” by Liotta’s death.
“He was so uniquely gifted, so adventurous, so courageous as an actor,” Scorsese said in a statement.
On Tuesday, Scorsese said he “regrets” not being able to work with Liotta again before his untimely death.
“I wish I’d had the chance to see him just once more, too — to tell him just how much the work we did together meant to me. But maybe he knew that. I hope so,” the Oscar-winning director, 79, wrote in an op-ed for the Guardian.
