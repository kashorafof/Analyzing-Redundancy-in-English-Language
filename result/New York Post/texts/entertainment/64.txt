Paris and Prince Jackson — the children of the late Michael Jackson — honored their father Sunday during the 2022 Tony Awards.
The pair took the stage at Radio City Music Hall to present a performance by the cast of “MJ: The Musical,” which depicts a major part of their father’s life and was nominated for the top award.
Prince, 25, and Paris, 24, reaffirmed the late King of Pop’s love of musicals in a rare appearance celebrating their dad.
“A lot of people seem to think our dad Michael Jackson changed popular music forever,” Prince Jackson said. “And who are we to disagree?”
“But what people may not know is he loved musicals, on film and on the stage. That’s why we are so incredibly honored to introduce the night’s first nominee for best musical, ‘MJ,’ which, using many of his iconic hits, looks at the complexities and brilliance of our father’s process.”
“MJ: The Musical” shows Jackson’s life during his “Dangerous” tour has been nominated for 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical and Actor. 
Paris Jackson recently revealed that King of Pop instilled a s strong work ethic and eclectic music taste in his kids.
“My dad was really good about making sure we were cultured, making sure we were educated, and not just showing us like the glitz and glam, like hotel hopping, five-star places,” Jackson said in an interview. 
“Growing up, it was about earning stuff. If we wanted five toys from FAO Schwarz or Toys R Us, we had to read five books,” she said.”
“It’s earning it, not just being entitled to certain things or thinking, ‘Oh, I got this.’ It’s like working for it, working hard for it — it’s, it’s something else entirely. It’s an accomplishment.”
