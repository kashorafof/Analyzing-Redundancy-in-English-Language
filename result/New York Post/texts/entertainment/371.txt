Think your life is busy? A woman has revealed how she is a mom to 34 kids at the age of 23.
TikTok user Tusayiwe Mkhondya uploaded a video showing her morning routine in the home she runs in Malawi for orphans, street kids and teen mothers.
Tusayiwe found herself as a homeless single mom at the age of 18 but opened her organization You Are Not Alone (Yana) shortly after.
The kids in her shelter range from five months up to the age of 16 and she has a very grueling routine when it comes to taking care of them.
On her @tusaiweyana account, she said: “All the kids are not abandoned. Some are orphans, some have only one parent, some have both parents but they have been abandoned by those parents.
Her day begins at 4 a.m., and she showed how she prepares all the food for the kids – including sandwiches, hot dinners and juice boxes.
She added: “ I am the only one who cooks for the under 5 children and every child has his/her own morning chores.”
The kids go to bed at 7 p.m. but her night shift really starts then as lots of the babies will wake up to feed.
She said: “I have to feed them and also change their diapers and I also have to prepare for work and the next day.”
Many people praised her efforts, with one saying: “You are doing an amazing thing for all of them! Keep it up!!”
Another added: “may God reward you abundantly.”
