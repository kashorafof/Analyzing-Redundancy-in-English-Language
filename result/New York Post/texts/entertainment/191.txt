A woman has revealed how her boyfriend cruelly dumped her and said she wasn’t pretty enough – but has now had the last laugh.
TikTok user @kim.decker showed how she now works as a model and looks very different.
In a video that has racked up over 100,000 views, she showed her before and after photos.
She wrote: “Me: so you are breaking up with me because I’m not attractive enough?
“Him: yeah I know I can find someone prettier, sorry.
“Me: okkeyyyy let’s goooooo.”
Kim then showed herself working on a modelling shoot aged 20 looking very glamorous.
She tagged the video “#glowup” and people have been quick to weigh in her transformation.
One person said: “youre so pretty its unbelivable.”
Another added: “you were pretty b4 and after.”
And a third wrote: “his loss”.
One joked: “Hahahahaha how strong is that first picture”, and Kim replied: “Mom always thought she had 2 sons until puberty.”
