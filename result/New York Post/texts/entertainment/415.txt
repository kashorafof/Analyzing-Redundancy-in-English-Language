The Prince of Darkness is back releasing music barely two weeks after his “life-altering surgery.”
On Friday, fans were treated to his new song, “Patient Number 9,” and a music video directed by “The Amazing Spider Man” artist Todd McFarlane.
The video features Osbourne portraying a patient at a mental institution along with an illustrated version of him drawn by McFarlane. He fights demons in the two distinct styles.
“The song is about a mental institution,” Osbourne said of the title track in a statement to Loudwire. “Having someone like Jeff Beck play on my album is just incredible, a total honor. There’s no other guitar player that plays like him and his solo on ‘Patient Number 9’ is just jaw-dropping.”
The album is set to have an all-star lineup including Pearl Jam’s Mike McCready, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, Zakk Wylde, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo, Duff McKagan, Eric Clapton and the late Taylor Hawkins. Even Osbourne’s former Black Sabbath bandmate, Tony Iommi, is making his first debut on one of his solo albums.
“Patient Number 9” comes out shortly after the singer underwent surgery to realign pins in his neck and back. This is in addition to suffering from Parkinson’s Disease.
The former Black Sabbath star had been suffering from neck injuries dating back to 2003 which stemmed from a quad biking accident. A fall in 2019 made the condition worse and 15 screws were inserted into his back. 
Osbourne was discharged one day after the surgery, June 14, and is still on the road to recovery.
“I am definitely feeling the love and support from all my fans and send everyone a big thank you for their thoughts, prayers and well wishes during my recovery,” he said in an Instagram post. 
His wife Sharon also mentioned that “he’s feeling good” in a social media post.
