Zosia Mamet, the actress and daughter of playwright royal David Mamet and actress Lindsay Crouse, has sold her Upper West Side apartment for $1.2 million. 
Mamet killed it in “The Flight Attendant,“ where she played Kaley Cuoco’s best friend on and off screen in a more grown-up version of her starring role in Lena Dunham’s often-maligned “Girls.” 
The two- or flexible three-bedroom maisonette-style apartment is in a prewar building designed by Rosario Candela at 522 West End Ave. 
Listed most recently for $1.25 million in February, this deal comes at a bit of a loss for Mamet, who purchased the spread in 2015 for $1.22 million. 
An entry foyer opens to a large living area between two bedrooms — and a windowed, wood-paneled dining room. Both bedrooms overlook the building’s rear garden. 
The unit also features a kitchen with lots of storage and details like restored solid hardwood floors, original wainscoting, high ceilings and large windows. The building comes with a shared back patio garden and bike storage.
The listing broker was Colin Montgomery of Sotheby’s International Realty.
