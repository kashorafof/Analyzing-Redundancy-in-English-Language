From TV chef to film star!
Guy Fieri is heading to the big screen for the Tom Brady film, “80 for Brady.”
The “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives” host, 54, will be making a cameo appearance.
The road-trip comedy will also star “Pose” alum Billy Porter and hails from Paramount Pictures, according to the Hollywood Reporter, but Porter’s role is still being kept under wraps.
The NFL player, 44, is at the helm of the movie, as he is starring in as well as producing the flick.
The project, which has finished filming, also features legendary actresses Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno and Sally Field.
The plot is inspired by a true story and follows four besties and New England Patriots fans (played by Tomlin, Fonda, Moreno and Field), who take a trip to the 2017 Super Bowl to see their favorite quarterback.
The production is directed by Kyle Marvin, who co-wrote with Michael Covino the script that’s based on a draft by “Booksmart“ writers Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins.
Brady announced the casting of Porter, 52, and Fieri on Thursday, hilariously tweeting, “Did someone say road trip?” and tagged both men.
The football star added a GIF of the restaurateur riding in a red convertible with: “So that’s it for this Flavortown road trip!”

Both the mayor of Flavortown and the Tony Award winner retweeted the fun news.

A release date has yet to be set for the upcoming film.
