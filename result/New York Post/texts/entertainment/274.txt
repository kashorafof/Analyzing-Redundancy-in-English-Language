Maryse, wife of WWE wrestler The Miz and a former women’s champion in the wrestling promotion, revealed the harrowing circumstances surrounding the death of her father, Guy, when she was 15 years old.
On the season premiere Monday of “Miz and Mrs.,” the couple’s reality show on USA Network, one of the storylines was that the two were finding a new home in the Los Angeles area for Maryse’s mother, Marjo, who had been living with them for the last eight years. 
While explaining the respective family relationships, Maryse shared the unfortunate circumstances of her father’s passing. 
“My dad passed in 1998. When I was 15, he was up in the mountains biking,” she said. “We could really never find out exactly what he passed of because we found his body in July 2003. Someone was biking and left the trail and saw the bones, so they called the Canadian version of the FBI. We assumed he had a heart attack.”
Maryse said of her mother that it was not about coldly kicking her out of the house, but allowing her to spread her own wings.
“My mom just really ended up on her own with three kids, and she made it work,” Maryse said. “But that was a very challenging time, and she’s been dragging that baggage for 20 years. She’s been with my brother, she’s lived with my sister, she’s lived with me, and she lives her life through our lives. So she needs to have her own place and her own life.”
On the show, Marjo explained that she still mourns her late husband.
“Every day, not one day I don’t think of your dad. I sit outside at night and every night I watch the moon and I think of your dad,” she told Maryse.
