What does German-based Adidas have in common with Italy’s infamous fashion house Gucci? Both make iconic, stylish staples and are two of the biggest names in fashion history, and today, we can see they can really create an internet-breaking collaboration.
On June 7, Adidas and Gucci dropped the highly anticipated Adidas x Gucci collaboration, which debuted on the fall 2022 runway. 
Since then, stars such as Madonna and her son David Banda have been spotted wearing the desired collection as we mere mortals anticipated its retail store launch. 
Now, the collection extends beyond the stars and the catwalk. It’s live.
Starting today, fans can discover the collection on the design house’s website, the Adidas Confirmed app, select stores and pop-up shops in Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Chicago and Houston.
The collection includes men’s and women’s shoes, accessories, jewelry and lifestyle pieces. Each desirable item from the cool clothing collab adheres to Gucci’s edgy, exclusive elegance while maintaining the modern ubiquity of Adidas.
Further design details include various amalgamations of the iconic Gucci and Adidas logos, Gucci red and green colors and the famous Adidas three stripes. And if we do say so ourselves, the collection nods to the allure of vintage (an idea designer Alessandro Michele thoroughly enjoys) as the style assortment includes tube socks, tracksuits, bold prints and vibrant colors.
