A young Phillies fan’s prayer was answered when Bryson Stott belted a walk-off homer against the Angels on Sunday.
With it being the bottom of the ninth, a 3-2 count, and two outs, the youngster was shown on the broadcast clasping his hands together in search of an answer. He got one when Scott’s three-run home run lifted the Phillies 9-7 over Los Angeles.
The fan, who sported an inside-out rally cap, jumped for joy when the ball crossed over the right-field fence of Citizens Bank Park.
The thrilling Phillies win accounted for their fourth in a row. 
It was also the third game under interim manager Rob Thomson, who has an undefeated record of 3-0 after taking over for the fired Joe Girardi Friday.
Los Angeles blew a 6-2 lead in the eighth inning before going back ahead in the top of the ninth thanks to a Matt Duffy single that drove in Tyler Wade.

With the score at 7-6, two Phillies, Alec Bohm and Didi Gregorius, got on-base by singling in the bottom of the ninth before Stott hit the game-deciding dinger. 
The Angels suffered their 11th loss in a row. And to make matters worse, Angels star Mike Trout extended his hitless streak to a career-worst 26 at-bats.
