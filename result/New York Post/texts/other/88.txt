This guy set the wedding dance floor on fire. 
An apparently tipsy guest of an unnamed bride and groom got hold of celebration sparklers at their barnyard nuptials — and nearly caused a massive blaze in a now-viral video. 
In the wildly chaotic clip, which has sparked more than 9.1 million views on Twitter, a man named Craig or Greg is seen haphazardly dancing around with sparklers in both hands while onlookers praise him for his moves.
However, while grinding on a female partygoer in a denim jacket, the carouser accidentally set a pampas grass centerpiece aflame. 
“Ah, fire! Fire!” screamed freaked-out guests while the dude — who appeared to be the life of the party — calmly continued boogying.

But when folks began frantically scrambling for water to extinguish the fire, the merry guest decided that his arm would do the trick. 
Per footage of the fiasco, the unflappable guy, wearing a casual suit, fearlessly waves his arm over the open flame and knocks the burning floral piece to the ground. 
Magically, without catching fire, the rowdy reveler then stomps out the blaze and immediately resumes grooving. 
However, a seemingly perturbed woman in a hat snaps at the man, instructing him to settle down, which brings his spirited partying to a sobering stop. 
So far, the woozy wedding-fire starter-turned-firefighter has not been identified. 
But Internet audiences have hailed him as their seemingly hammered hero. 
“This how drunk I’m tryna be at my wedding,” tweeted an impressed watcher. 
“Also a person I admire this week: #Dancing #drunk #wedding guy, because although he had too much to drink and almost made the 10:00 o’clock news, he’s celebrating life,” another cyber cheerer wrote, in part. 
Others were simply stunned by the dope’s flame-resistant capabilities. 
“Awareness level: 0, drunkenness level: 98, fireproof superpowers: 100,” joked a fan of the guy.
