All Christian McCaffrey wanted for his birthday this year was a cozy night in with girlfriend Olivia Culpo.
The Panthers running back, who turned 26 on Tuesday, enjoyed a home-cooked meal with Culpo, 30, and their adorable pup, Oliver Sprinkles, according to a series of Instagram Stories shared on the model’s page.
“All Christian wanted to do for his birthday was cook together,” Culpo shared in one post, later joking that “cooking together” meant McCaffrey snoozing on the couch with the couple’s four-legged friend.
Culpo, who has been dating McCaffrey for nearly three years, appeared to gift the Pro Bowler a bottle of champagne and sweet treats for his special day. The twosome all capped off their evening by watching the latest season of “Stranger Things” in bed.
Earlier in the day Tuesday, Culpo posted a sweet birthday tribute to McCaffrey on Instagram, calling him “the most dependable, inspiring, thoughtful + grounding” person she knows.
“It’s someone’s birthday!! I love you so much Christian. You are the most dependable, inspiring, thoughtful, + grounding person and I feel so lucky to call you mine,” the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit stunner gushed of McCaffrey, who replied, “I love you!”
Last month, McCaffrey helped Culpo celebrate her 30th birthday, which the former Miss Universe chronicled on social media. In a video posted online, Culpo is seen twirling on a pole while riding on a party bus with loved ones. 
“30th birthday! This milestone scared me but I have to say I feel so incredibly grateful for the people in my life, and for all of you,” Culpo posted on Instagram in May. “Thank you for following my crazy journey through life and giving me an outlet to be myself.”
