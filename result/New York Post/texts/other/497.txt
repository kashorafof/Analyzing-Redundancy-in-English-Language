Ayesha Curry can cook and drop it low on the dance floor.  
Steph Curry and the famed cookbook author partied hard after the Warriors parade took over the streets of San Francisco on Monday to celebrate the teamâ€™s NBA title.
The couple was filmed grinding on the dance floor at Ayeshaâ€™s restaurant, International Smoke â€” an upscale barbecue restaurant chain, with locations in the Bay Area and Las Vegas â€” where the team partied after the parade.

Curry held his 2022 Finals MVP trophy while he danced with Ayesha on the yellow and blue confetti-covered floor.  
The Currys appeared to be the life of the party, where teammate Andrew Wiggins and girlfriend Mychal Johnson were spotted in videos posted to Twitter. 
Damion Lee, Curryâ€™s teammate and brother-in-law, was present with his wife, Sydel Curry-Lee. The party was supplied with white and red Domaine Curry Wine, the brand Ayesha runs with Sydel.
At one point, Curry was spotted chugging Clase Azul tequila from the bottle, while his sister held his Finals MVP trophy.
