President Biden signed a bipartisan gun control measure into law Saturday, predicting the legislation will “save lives.” 
“I was there 30 years ago the last time this nation passed meaningful gun safety laws;” Biden said. “While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that will save lives.”
First Lady Jill Biden stood by her husband’s side as he spoke. 
“If we can reach compromise on guns, we should to be able to reach compromise on other critical issues,” Biden said and offered a special thank you to the families impacted by gun violence.   
“They led the way so other families will not have the experience of pain and trauma that they had.”
After Biden signed the bill — which includes enhanced background checks on the youngest gun buyers, provides millions for mental health services and gives state’s incentive to pass red flag laws —  a reporter asked whether he believed the Supreme Court was “broken,” in the wake of its decision to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade decision that protected women’s rights to abortion on Friday.
“I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions,” he said.
Biden’s gun control bill also got a ringing endorsement Saturday from Mayor Eric Adams, who called the measures “historic.”
“The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is an important step in the right direction, and one of the few productive measures Congress has taken in decades towards ending the scourge of gun violence facing our city and country,” Adams said — but noted the moment was bittersweet given another Supreme Court decision striking down a century-old city law severely restricting concealed carry in the city.
“The U.S. Supreme Court may have opened up a river leading to the sea of gun violence this week,” Adams warned.
