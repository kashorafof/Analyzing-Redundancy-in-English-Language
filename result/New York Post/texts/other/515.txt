Billy Eppler boarded a plane in California. Sandy Alderson did the same in Florida on his 74th birthday. They were converging on Arizona.
Lunch was planned in Scottsdale that Monday. This meal, at the True Food Test Kitchen on Nov. 22, would initiate arguably the most transformative week in franchise history. By Sunday night Steve Cohen had blessed the largest per-annum contract in baseball history for Max Scherzer, overshadowing what had come in the days prior.
But as the season is revealing, the $124.5 million outlay the Mets made in a roughly 48-hour period for Mark Canha, Eduardo Escobar and Starling Marte is proving as instrumental — possibly more — than the $130 million ($43.3 million on average annually) that Scherzer was guaranteed. It strengthened and deepened a lineup, a style of play and a mindset that the Mets wanted to construct.
And the appetizer to the flurry of signings was a meal in which Alderson, the team president, and Eppler, on the job as general manager less than a week, sold Canha and his wife, Marci, on a vision.
