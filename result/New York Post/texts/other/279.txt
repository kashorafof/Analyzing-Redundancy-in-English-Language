Is it really summer without the smell of barbecue? It’s grill season, and this year, you can step it up without even leaving your yard. You could fight at the store for a limited selection of sauces to add some new zest to your favorite meats, or you could have them delivered and get an even better sampling. Whether you need a marinade before you head out to the barbecue or a dipping sauce for some fried chicken, The 6-Pak Bundle of BBQ sauces gets delivered right to your door and has flavors that can’t be beat. For a limited time, it’s also on sale for $49.95 (Reg. $55). 
Grilling is practically a national pastime, whether you’re using a fancy fire pit or have the latest grilling accessories. It’s a fun way to get your family or friends together around a big pile of food that smells incredible. And it’s even pretty healthy. With everyone waiting and smelling what’s cooking, you want to produce the best meal you can. 
 You might be able to get the perfect sear on your beef or just the right crisp on your wings, but sometimes you want a new flavor. And you probably don’t want to go all the way to the store for it either. The 6-Pak Bundle sends six incredible barbecue sauces right to your door, and the selection is incredible. You’ve got “The Original,”  “Atomic Pineapple,” “Southern Mustard,” “Carne Sutra,” “Sweet BBQ Love,” and “Zesty Taco.” 
It’s not just that these sauces themselves are a tangy, zesty festival of flavor. Having them delivered to you means you aren’t locked into any one flavor profile until you add the sauce. Feel like a tropical drumstick and a classic T-bone? Maybe some Southern hospitality on your plate and some rich bbq goodness ready for seconds? All you need is the meat, maybe a drink, and the 6-Pak has the rest generously covered. 
Open the door for flavor. For a limited time, you can get The 6-Pak Bundle on sale for $49.99 (Reg. $55).
