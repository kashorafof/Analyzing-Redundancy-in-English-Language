If you can find all the tigers in this mind-bending optical illusion it means you belong in the top one percent of viewers.
The beautiful nature image hides a number of tigers – how many can you spot?
The tricky optical illusion shows two tigers with their cubs surrounded by trees.
But there are more tigers hidden in the image – about sixteen to be exact.

“It’s almost impossible to find all of them so let me know how many you can see.”
The picture has left viewers baffled as many struggled to find all of them.
One said: “I found 12.”
Another one added: “The more I look… the more appear.”
One commented: “I found all look at the one standing then look to the right.”
