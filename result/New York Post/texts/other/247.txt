Chicago rapper FBG Cash was reportedly shot and killed in Chicago on Friday.
ABC7 Chicago reported that police had responded to a shooting that occurred earlier that morning, involving the 31-year-old rapper,  whose real name is Tristian Hamilton, according to the Cook County Bureau of Administration.
A man and a woman were inside their vehicle when the unknown offender pulled up in a black four-door sedan, got out and opened fire at the victims before jumping back into their car.
The 29-year-old female victim sustained gunshot wounds to the left arm and upper back, according to ABC7 Chicago, and was transferred to Advocate Christ Medical Center where she’s now in critical condition.
Meanwhile, Hamilton had suffered several gunshot wounds throughout his body. He was taken to the same hospital, where he was ultimately pronounced dead.
No one has been arrested in connection with the incident as detectives continue their investigation.
The Post has reached out to FBG Cash’s management for comment.
FBG Cash was a member of Chicago’s Fly Boy Gang [FBG] crew, also called the Clout Boyz or “tooka gang,” alongside rappers Lil Jay, Wooski, Billionaire Black, Young Mello, FBG Dutchie and the late FBG Duck, who was killed in 2020. 
Just two weeks ago, the musician came out with a music video for his single “Intro.”
