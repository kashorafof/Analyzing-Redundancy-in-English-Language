A Rangers fan who punched two other fans after Game 5 at Madison Square Garden on Thursday has been banned from the venue for life.
Garden officials responded to a viral video that showed a Rangers fan knock a Tampa Bay Lightning fan unconscious inside the venue. 
“Last night, an abhorrent assault took place against a Tampa Bay fan at the conclusion of the game — followed by a second assault against an individual who bravely intervened,” MSG said in the statement. “We are cooperating fully with law enforcement as this is now a criminal matter. The assailant will also be banned from The Garden and all other MSG venues for life.”
In now-viral videos, a man, identified by police as 29-year-old James Anastasio from Staten Island was walking in front of one of the victims, who was wearing a Tampa Bay jersey, and knocked him out with a single punch to the face following the Rangers’ 3-1 loss to the Lightning. The victim fell to the floor, where he was attended to by fans, while others yelled for security. 
Anastasio was arrested and charged with two counts of assault, two counts of disorderly conduct, and two counts of harassment, cops confirmed to The Post.
Police said the fan in the Lightning jersey was suffering from pain and bruising, while a male eyewitness was also punched in the face when he tried stop Anastasio, who attempted to flee the scene. Police said the eyewitness sustained pain and bruising to his face, though both victims refused medical attention.
According to police, there was an interaction between Anastasio and the Lightning fan involved prior to the assault.
Jason Goldman, lawyer for Anastasio, told The Post his client will be arraigned Friday evening.
