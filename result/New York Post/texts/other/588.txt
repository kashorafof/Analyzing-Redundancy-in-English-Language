Two people — including a 16-year-old boy — were killed in separate shootings in Brooklyn overnight, police said.
In the latest deadly incident, the 16-year-old was fatally shot in the torso at about 3:15 a.m. Saturday near the corner of Sutter Avenue and Osborn Street in Brownsville, authorities said.
Police are investigating whether the teen was the intended target, sources said.
A cousin of the victim told detectives the shooting happened after he and the victim decided to walk to a relative’s home on Blake Avenue and cut through the Dr. Green Playground on Sutter Avenue and  Mother Gaston Boulevard, the sources said. 
The cousin said that when they were approaching Osborn Street he heard one shot coming from in front of him and turned around and ran, the sources said.
The cousin said the 16-year-old had been shot in the stomach and called 911, the sources said. 
Detectives also spoke to a woman who said she called 911 after she heard a single gunshot, looked out her window and saw a male lying on the ground saying he was hit, the sources said. 
EMS transported the “unconscious and unresponsive” teen to Brookdale Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, cops said. There are no arrests.
At about 9:20 p.m. Friday, a 43-year-old man was found shot multiple times in the chest in the vicinity of the 1700 block of Carroll Street, near Crown Street in the Weeksville section, police said. 
EMS transported the mortally wounded victim to Kings County Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. There are no arrests.
