The Russian army has lost so many soldiers in its unjustified war in Ukraine that it has resorted to storing its dead soldiers’ corpses in a meat-packing plant which has been repurposed as a morgue, according to Ukrainian officials.
The intelligence division of the Ukrainian defense ministry said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army has run out of room to store the mounting number of dead troops.
Officials said the Russians were looking for “additional refrigerators” to store the bodies in the occupied city of Melitopol, southeast of the capital Kyiv.
“The occupation administration of Melitopol is urgently looking for additional freezers and industrial refrigerators,” the statement read.
“It is known that the city meat-packing plant, which was converted into a morgue, is already completely filled with the bodies of the killed occupiers and can no longer accept more.”
The Russian army began converting the meat-packing plant into a makeshift morgue on Monday, the defense ministry said.
Owners of the plant were reportedly ordered to give up the plant free of charge to the Russians.
The troops stored there died in clashes near the embattled cities of Polohy and Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian officials said. 
“These events are associated with heavy losses of the occupiers in manpower,” the Ukrainian defense ministry said in the press release.
“In addition, the long-term storage of the bodies of those killed is due to the intentions of the Russian leadership to hide the real scale of losses from the Russian electorate.”
Russian officials have not publicly responded to the claims.
Russian forces seized Melitopol in February during the first week of its invasion of Ukraine.
In March, Russian military forces installed a new mayor in Melitopol after its elected mayor was kidnapped by a group of 10 Russian soldiers.
