A southern California man murdered his mother and dismembered her corpse before hiding the body parts in the dumpster of their apartment complex, authorities say.
David Hoetzlein, 25, was arrested Friday night at his home in Camarillo after cops found the dismembered corpse of his 62-year-old mother Tomoko hours earlier, the Ventura County Sherriff’s Office said.
Cops discovered the body parts in the trash container around 6:50 a.m. after receiving a call regarding “suspicious circumstances” at the Las Positas Apartments, cops said. 
Sherriff’s deputies obtained a warrant to search the pair’s shared apartment and found “evidence” there that “connected David to the murder of his mother,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.
Hoetzlein remains in custody on murder charges in lieu of $3 million bail.
A neighbor told KLTA that the younger Hoetzlein “barricaded himself” in the apartment in an attempt to evade capture.
“They were able to get him out at about 3:30,” Kathy Kennedy told the station.
The alleged killer will appear in court Tuesday.
