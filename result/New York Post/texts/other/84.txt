LSU forward Shareef O’Neal, son of Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal, is scheduled to workout with another one of his father’s old teams.
The Athletic reported the Lakers – with whom Shaq spent the largest chunk of his career – are holding a pre-draft workout for O’Neal some time in the upcoming days.
The younger O’Neal’s workout for Los Angeles will come just days after the NBA draft prospect worked out with the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday. The 22-year-old additionally has planned visits with the Atlanta Hawks, Washington Wizards and Cleveland Cavaliers.
Shareef’s journey to this point has been riddled with obstacles. Earlier this week, it remained uncertain whether he was even eligible to be selected in the 2022 NBA Draft after his name was mistakenly included on a list of withdrawals. According to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, this mistake has been corrected and O’Neal is indeed eligible. 
Prior to attending college, O’Neal decommitted from Arizona amidst an FBI investigation into the program. He later committed to UCLA, where he was diagnosed with a heart condition that required surgery and sidelined him for his entire freshman season. 
O’Neal eventually transferred to LSU – his father’s alma mater – but struggled to stay on the court due to injuries. After averaging 2.9 points and 2.1 rebounds in 14 games off the bench this past season for the Tigers, O’Neal entered the transfer portal before ultimately declaring for the draft.  
Once a four-star recruit coming out of high school, O’Neal’s frequent injuries and bad luck prevented him from showcasing his true abilities in college. The Lakers, among others, still believe he has lots to offer.
