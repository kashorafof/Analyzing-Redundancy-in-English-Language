A second teacher was removed from a Queens high school this month amid accusations of sexual misconduct with students.
Scott Biski, 48, a music teacher at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences HS, was rubber roomed last week after accusations surfaced that he had a sexual relationship with a former student, officials confirmed.
“This alleged behavior is absolutely reprehensible and will not be tolerated. This employee was removed from the school and students,”  Department of Education spokeswoman Jenna Lyle told The Post.
“The Special Commissioner of Investigation (SCI)  for city schools is probing the allegations, officials said.
Biski’s ouster from the 492-student school comes less than three weeks after teacher Shannon Hall, 31, was arrested June 2 on charges he sent sexually explicit text messages to a student, saying. “I want to be with you,” and threatening “she would be dead” if she shared the texts.
Hall also “grabbed and squeezed” a 14-year-old student’s breast over her clothing while in his classroom May 25, a complaint filed by Queens DA Melinda Katz states.
The back-to-back sexual misconduct cases left faculty members reeling. One told The Post that  staffers had complained to Principal Caren Birchwood-Taylor about Hall months before his arrest but nothing was done.
A third teacher was allegedly flagged for making students feel uncomfortable but has not been disciplined.  Department of Education spokeswoman Jenna Lyle said, “A full investigation was done at the school level which determined there were no genuine concerns from students regarding this teacher.”
Biski, a teacher at the Jamaica school since 2012, did not return a request for comment.
