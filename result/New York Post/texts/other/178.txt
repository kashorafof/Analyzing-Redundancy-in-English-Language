A body-positive influencer has hit back at cruel trolls who tell her she is too big to wear a bikini.
Olivia Nicole Duffin, from the UK, took to TikTok after receiving comments about how she shouldn’t wear a bikini on her curvy body.
In the short video, Olivia can be seen wearing a dressing gown as she lists some of the cruel comments she has received about her body.
“You’re so fat,” reads one.
Another said: “Not a bikini body.”
“She looks like a whale,” a further person remarked.
But the trolls have clearly picked on the wrong girl as Olivia is unfazed by their harsh comments.
She smiles at the camera miming ‘what’s the problem?’ as she transitions into a stunning cobalt blue two-piece bikini.
Olivia revealed wearing a bikini makes her confident and powerful.
The video has since gone viral with almost 200k views and has been inundated with comments from people praising her for her body positivity.
