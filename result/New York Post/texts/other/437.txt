Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is stirring rumors of a possible presidential run in 2024.
On Saturday, the Old Dominion governor is set to deliver a speech at Nebraska’s GOP convention. Youngkin won a surprise victory in Virginia last year after turning the reliably blue state red in a race which highlighted parental concern about critical race theory in schools.
Though Nebraska isn’t Iowa, the two share media markets and Youngkin’s visit is likely to percolate in that most critical early primary state. 
“Going to Nebraska is as close as going to Iowa without actually stepping foot in the state,” Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican consultant told Fox News. “It’s hard to know for sure his motivation, but it seems like he’s at least exploring or heavily flirting with the idea of a run.” 
Team Youngkin denied any speculation of potential future ambitions and said he was only making the trip as a favor to his friend, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, who chairs the Republican Governor’s Association.
