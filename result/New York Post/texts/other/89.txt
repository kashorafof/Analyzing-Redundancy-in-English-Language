From football to clothing, Tom Brady certainly wears many hats — or rather, helmets (wink, wink).
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback launched his signature clothing line, BRADY, in January 2021, a premium shop offering everything from tanks and shorts to jackets and now, underwear.
Brady’s namesake apparel brand is excited to foray into the undergarment space, releasing fabric technology-blended briefs that come in five match-all colorways.
Whether you’re shopping its ink, glacier, storm, fog or cerulean tones (perhaps all of them!), you won’t be disappointed. Impressively, all selections feature breathable cotton and quality shape retention to put your best bum forward.
What’s more, the briefs are all clad with a darted molded pouch for unbeatable comfort (which is key for underwear, but that you probably know). Its jacquard soft-touch waistband is a nice touch, too.
The undergarments are affordably priced, so you’re receiving quality, comfort and a budget-friendly buy with this pro-athlete-tied launch. The five-pack is $85, while individual briefs are just $20. You can also score a three-pack for $55 for that middle-of-the-round option, too.
