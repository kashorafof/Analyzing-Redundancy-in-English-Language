Update: A spokesperson for Amazon has told The Post, “The selling partner confirmed that they have been sending color dye as a complementary product to help customers keep their chairs looking like new.”
Surprises in the mail are always fun — except when it’s a vial of what appears to be human blood.
Jen Begakis claimed that she ordered a leather chair from Amazon, but then found an unsettling addition to the package when she took it out of the box.
“If I told you the leather chair I ordered from Amazon was packaged with a blood collection tube that is…full, would you believe me?” she claimed in a post to Twitter.
“Because I’m lost for – – – words.”
“I’m as terrified as I am confused,” the Ph.D. candidate wrote, adding a 24-second video of the box and vial of blood to the Tweet.
“I’m so profoundly unprepared [for] this type of chaos,” she quipped in reply to comments on the post.
Begakis later updated followers on her blood-saga, alleging that she initially heard from Amazon but reportedly hasn’t heard from them again.
The Post has reached out to Amazon and Begakis for comment.

Since initially tweeting the video, Begakis’ tweet has been retweeted more than 3,500 times and topped 48,800 likes. 
In the video posted online, Begakis films the cardboard box on the floor, showing bubble-wrapped chair pieces on the floor before displaying the single vial in the box, which appears to, indeed, be full of blood.
“Amazon emailed me last night and said it’s ‘expedited to top priority’ but I haven’t heard anything since. so… the vile is in the same spot from last night,” she wrote in response to another commenter.
“I just closed the box and let it have some peace an quiet,” she said of the apparently still-untouched bonus package.
