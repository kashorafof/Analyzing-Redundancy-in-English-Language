Remember those (brief) shining moments when the world hailed the election of Joe Biden as a return to competence? 
Turns out Uncle Joe couldn’t even manage to keep US Embassy phone lines open. WNBA star Brittney Griner — detained for months by Russia, and whom Biden has so far failed to free — couldn’t get through to her wife Cherelle via an embassy line despite calling 11 times on a date arranged weeks in advance. 
Why? Because no embassy staffer was there to pick up the phone and connect them. White House flack Karine Jean-Pierre called this an “unfortunate mistake.” 
Ya think? Cherelle Griner did not spare the Biden administration any vitriol in her response to the situation. “How can I trust you to actually be negotiating on my wife’s behalf to come home,” she thundered. 
The mess is symptomatic of how Biden operates. Spout off a few platitudes, throw some federal dollars around and then: on to the next crisis! All while neglecting the crucial, annoying details that make the difference between success and humiliating failure. 
Look at Afghanistan. Or the border. Or inflation. The list goes on. 
Biden’s macro failures are glaringly obvious. It’s no shock they trickle down and hurt people already suffering — and embarrass America in the bargain.
