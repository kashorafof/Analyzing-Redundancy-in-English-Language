They’re talking dirty to keep streets clean.
A city in Sweden has installed public trash cans with audio that purrs sexy comments of encouragement to folks who deposit their litter.
“Oh, right there, yes!” the cans coo, in a sultry female voice. “Hmmm, yeah…that was crazy good.”
As part of a clean-up campaign, the seaside city of Malmö programmed its high-tech rubbish bins to sense when trash is tossed and give steamy positive feedback, according to The Local.
The sex pot receptacles also cry out, “Just to the left!” and, “Come back soon and do that again!” 
The hot trash talk is meant to create conversation about the importance of keeping public spaces pristine, said Marie Persson, chief of the city’s roads department.
“[It’s] a new, humorous way to get across our message,” Persson told the Sydsvenskan newspaper. “The sentences are part of the campaign’s intention to get more people to talk about the dirtiest thing there is: littering. The stuff that ends up in our streets, squares, and sea.”
The city bought 18 of the “advanced rubbish bins”  in 2017, and only two so far speak in the seductive voice, she said.
The woman behind the dirty talk is a “a famous person” who wants to remain anonymous, Persson said.
