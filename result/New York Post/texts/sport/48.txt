Derek Carr would be enthusiastic about sharing the Raiders’ quarterback room with Colin Kaepernick.
Kaepernick worked out with the Raiders in May, but remains a free agent. 
The 31-year-old Carr spoke to reporters on Tuesday and made it clear he would welcome the opportunity to be teammates with Kaepernick.
“I’ve known Colin since our days playing in the WAC conference, which is no longer a thing,” Carr said.
“My gray hairs may start to make a point for that. I remember our days back then, and just watching him, and what he did at college, and getting to know him, and talking to him on the phone — I’ve loved my time with him. I think he’s a great guy. He’s been great to be around. I’ve enjoyed being around him, talking with him, competing against him.

“And so, Josh [McDaniels] told me they were doing it, and I said the same thing I’m telling you. I’ve enjoyed my time around him. I love him — him and I would get along great. My brother [David] knew him from San Francisco. He said, ‘I love Colin. He’s awesome.’ I think Colin would have to answer more questions than the rest of us would have to.”
Kaepernick, 34, has been out of the NFL since 2016, a season in which he knelt during the national anthem to protest social injustice. 
“For us, I think he’d be great,” Carr said. “I don’t want to speak for everybody in that kind of sense, like I don’t want someone mad at me for saying he’d be great, but I know him and I would get along great. We have in the past and I think we would again. For the most part, I think he’d get along just fine with our guys.”
Carr would not have to worry about job security if the move wound up happening. This offseason, he signed a three-year extension worth over $120 million that ties him to the Raiders through 2025.
