Keeping our foot on the gas, we head to Detroit, where the Blue Jays are spending the weekend. 
Jose Berrios (4-2, 5.24) throws for Toronto. Mediocre numbers for Berrios, but he was in control of his last start, three-hitting the Twinkies over seven strong, fanning 13 for the win. 
The Tigers’ Elvin Rodriguez (0-1, 10.13) has had a rough go of it in his rookie campaign. That fat ERA El-Rod owns is courtesy of the Yankees, who scored 10 runs in just 4 ¹/₃ innings. Play 10 units on the Jays.
Philler up! Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber and pinch-hitter Odubel Herrera homered and the Phillies bruised the Brewers, 8-3. Win has us at a season high +1,014 rossiellos.
