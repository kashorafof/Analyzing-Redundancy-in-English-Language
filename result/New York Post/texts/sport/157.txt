An 11-year-old boy was critically injured after being struck and then dragged by an ice cream truck in Brooklyn, police said.
The youth was riding his bike on Sutter Avenue at about 6:45 p.m. Friday when a 58-year-old man driving the truck southbound on Hendrix struck the 11-year-old, police sources said.
The child was in a crosswalk and both he and the bike were dragged by the truck for a short distance, police said.
EMS transported the child to Brookdale Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition, the sources said.
The driver, Juan Remigio of the Bronx, remained at the scene and was charged with aggravated unlicensed operation, failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to use due care, the NYPD said.
