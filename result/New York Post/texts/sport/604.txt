Reply to @hannahcaric0  I think I’m done having kids but if I were to have more I’d love to try a home birth with a midwife and doula that I choose and trust. #ScreamItOut #birthstory #pregnant #laboranddelivery #labortrauma #naturalbirth

A mom-of-three has revealed how her doctor yelled at her to be quiet in the middle of her labor.
Yasmyn Switzer, a mom to three daughters, shared the ordeal on TikTok.
The young mom, aged 20, revealed that her doctor yelled at her while she was giving birth to her youngest daughter.
Yasmyn explained that she stayed at home for most of the labor and only went into hospital an hour before her daughter was born, which was when the trouble started.
The mum first asked for water, as it was important to keep hydrated while in labor, and didn’t get any for half an hour and still wasn’t hooked up to an IV.
Two nurses then came to check on the mum, but she believes one of them was new as one nurse was explained how to check how dilated Yasmyn was.
When the doctor came in to assist with the birth, she was pushing, and as any woman would, she was making noises throughout the contractions and pushing.
She revealed: “In the middle of my contraction, the doctor goes ‘I’m going to need you to be quiet so that I can hear.’
“It was so rude, I’ve been with this doctor a lot through my pregnancies and she’s always not had the best bedside manners.”
Although Yasmyn said she doesn’t want any more children she said if she did she would not want to go to hospital for the birth after her ordeal.
She captioned the video: “I think I’m done having kids but if I were to have more I’d love to try a home birth with a midwife and doula that I choose and trust.” 
The video has since gone viral with over 200k views and many said she should make a complaint.
One wrote: “I would write the hospital a letter. So uncalled for! Especially at such a vulnerable time for you.”
“Jeez your literally pushing a human out of you they have no right,” commented another.
