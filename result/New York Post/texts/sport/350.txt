A 63-year-old man was pistol-whipped and robbed as he left a Queens subway station this week, authorities said. 
The victim was exiting the 75th Avenue station in Forest Hills around 8 p.m. Wednesday when two suspects approached him and pulled out a gun, cops said. 
They struck him in the head with the weapon multiple times before grabbing his watch, jewelry and about $1,000 before fleeing on foot into the station, police said. 
The victim was taken to Queens Hospital Center in stable condition with cuts on his head. 
Cops released surveillance footage of one of the muggers late Thursday.
