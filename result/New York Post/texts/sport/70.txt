If you’ve been following our coverage for a while, you know that we’re all about everything cozy: from men’s joggers and cloud-like duvets to plush robes and pajamas (for men and women)!
To celebrate the comfiness we know and love, we’re excited to announce an exclusive code available just for you — the devout New York Post Shopping reader who’s always on the lookout for a good deal or new product.
For a limited time — and spanning throughout the Fourth of July — Cozy Earth is offering 30% off site wide. That’s right, the comfy, cloud-feeling styles have been unlocked (and, at a discount).
Choose from the brand’s vast array of bedding and bath items, but be sure not to gloss over best-selling apparel and comfy basics for both men and women.
To take advantage of the special offer (which lasts until July 11, FYI), simply use the code NYPOST at checkout. And, get this — while you have an insider pass to use at your disposal, we curated our top 10 favorite pieces from Cozy Earth to make your shopping experience that much better.
One of our favorite sheets ever, the Cozy Earth’s Bamboo Sheet Set is conveniently 30% off for you to have that luxe sleep experience for a fraction of the cost. Not only are they breathable, but they’re made from 100% bamboo viscose, don’t pill as easily as others (thanks to the brand’s enhanced weave) and are some of the softest sheets you’ll find.
Elevate your sleepwear game with the Bamboo Stretch-Knit Pajama Set. Available in plenty of colors to choose from, we love the put-together look for this button-down, line-bordered style to take with you on vacations (or simply, nights at home) with your favorite slippers.
For that simplistic bedroom aesthetic, you can’t go wrong with Cozy Earth Comforters. As is the case for the brand’s bamboo sheets, they’re made of that 100% bamboo viscose and, when paired together, are a heavenly duo.
For hopping out of the shower in pure comfort, pick up The Premium Plush Bath Towels while they’re on sale. Conveniently, the two-pack is less than $100 for a limited time (not to mention, two is all you’ll ever need).
Let’s give you one piece of advice: buy these shorts. Personally, we’ve gifted them to our fathers, boyfriends and brothers (all of whom practically live in them at this point). You won’t be able to stop feeling the ultra-soft material; it’s truly like no other.
To pair with the matching bamboo shorts or the matching joggers, Cozy Earth’s Stretch-Knit Bamboo Lounge Tee is one you shouldn’t sleep on (rather, it should be one you can even sleep with). Perfect for lounge or on-the-go wear, the match-all color palette will make you want to buy one in every color.
If there’s anything fans of Cozy Earth (including Oprah) rave about, it’s The Plush Lounge Sock. This three-pack makes a great gift for a loved one or a practical stock-up for your nightstand drawer all the same. Plus, they come in various sizes and hues for men and women.
If you want to lounge around with a tee but don’t know what bottoms to grab, these are them. Cozy Earth’s Bamboo Joggers are on a wonderful discount right now just for you, so it’s about time you add these soon-to-be-lived-in bottoms to your shopping cart.
To pair with joggers, we can’t recommend the Ultra-Soft Bamboo Pullover Crew enough. It’s less than $100, has a breathable fabric that’ll keep you warm in cooler temps and airy in warmer temps alike and it’s easy to toss on for simple weekend days. We can’t stop raving about it IRL, too.
New from Cozy Earth is its linen bamboo collection, which is an optimal blend of 70% viscose bamboo and 30% linen for a bit lighter feel. The easy-breezy bedding is also moisture-wicking, which is especially great for the spring and summer months.
