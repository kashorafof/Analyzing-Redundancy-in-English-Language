Novak Djokovic is back on top of the tennis world after winning his seventh Wimbledon title on Sunday. As of now, he won’t be able to try for back-to-back majors at the 2022 U.S. Open starting next month.
Because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, Djokovic will not be allowed to enter the United States. That came after he was deported from Australia in January for not being vaccinated, keeping him out of the Australian Open. 
Djokovic’s looming absence from Flushing Meadows isn’t sitting well with John McEnroe, who railed against the rule on ESPN after Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the men’s Wimbledon final on Sunday.
“These politicians are getting in the way too much,” McEnroe said. “They did it in Australia. Let’s let the guy come in and play in the U.S. I mean, come on. This is ridiculous.”
McEnroe’s brother Patrick also weighed in on Djokovic being unable to compete at the U.S. Open.
“Whatever you think the government should or should not do, it’s a bummer for tennis,” he said on the broadcast.
Before Wimbledon began, Djokovic said he would not change his mind about getting the vaccine and acknowledged the likelihood that he would not be able to play in the U.S. Open, which he last won in 2018. He lost to Daniil Medvedev in last year’s U.S. Open final.
Djokovic said at the time that gave him “extra motivation” to play well at Wimbledon.
“I would love to go to States. But as of today, that’s not possible,” Djokovic said on June 25. “There is not much I can do anymore. I mean, it’s really up to the U.S. government to make a decision whether or not they allow unvaccinated people to go into the country.”
