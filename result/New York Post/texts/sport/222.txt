This puzzle is a win-win situation. It’s the perfect activity for the dog days of summer, letting you relax indoors with AC as you put together this fun 500-piece puzzle suitable for ages all the way down to three.

Once you’re done with the puzzle, you’ll see the big QR code that lets you know exactly how much you’ve won. All you have to do is open your camera on your phone or tablet, point it at that QR code for two to three seconds, and then marvel at your winnings — anything from $1 to $1,000,000. Once your winnings are revealed, you’ll receive a digital check to the email address where you ordered the puzzle from.
