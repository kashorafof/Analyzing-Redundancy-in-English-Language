Odell Beckham and the Cleveland Browns, take two?
That’s what Browns safety John Johnson III has been wishing for since March, when he spoke of Beckham’s return during an Instagram Live — a moment he now calls his “shot in the dark.”
“OBJ coming back,” Johnson said in March. “You ain’t hear it from me though.”
The 26-year-old clarified the comments on Wednesday.
“That was me recruiting,” Johnson said, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. “Honestly, there was no backstory to it. There was no insider information. It was just like, ‘I want him here. I’ve got a feeling that he might come back.’ But I don’t know. We’ll see.”
Beckham’s time in Cleveland came to a tumultuous end in November 2021, when he essentially forced himself off of the team. He went on to sign with the Rams, with whom he won his first Super Bowl in February. 
The 29-year-old wide receiver is currently a free agent as he continues to work his way back from an ACL tear he suffered during the Rams’ championship win over the Bengals.
Though a league source has since put the kibosh on a Beckham-Browns reunion, telling the Akron Beacon Journal it’s “unlikely,” the Rams have expressed interest in bringing him back, including the team’s newlywed head coach, Sean McVay.
During an appearance Monday on the “I AM ATHLETE” podcast, McVay — who married longtime fiancée Veronika Khomyn last weekend — revealed that Beckham crashed their wedding at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
“I said, ‘You crash the wedding, you re-sign with the Rams then, man,’” McVay quipped.
This week, the Rams agreed to a contract extension with wide receiver Cooper Kupp, offering the Super Bowl MVP a three-year, $80 million deal.
