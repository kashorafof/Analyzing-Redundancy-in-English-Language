Six members of Haiti’s Special Olympics delegation mysteriously went missing during the competition in Florida on Monday after returning their hotel room keys and leaving their luggage behind.
The Haitians were last seen around 2:30 p.m. as the games got underway at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Kissimmee, according to local outlets.
The Osceola County Sheriff’s Office identified the missing as Oriol Jean, 18, Anderson Petit-Frère, 18, Peter Mianovich Berlus, 19, Nicholson Fontilus, 20, Steevenson Jacquet, 24, and Antione Joseph Mithon, 34. 
All six turned in their hotel room keys and left their luggage in their rooms before they went missing.
The Special Olympics began on Sunday and runs through June 12 in and around Orlando. More than 5,500 athletes and coaches from the US and Caribbean nations are represented, organizers said.
Petit-Frère was one of the soccer players featured on Team Haiti’s Instagram account last week.
“My name is Anderson Petit-Frère, I am from Port-au-Prince and I am 18 years old,” the young athlete wrote.
“I am an unified player and I am part of the Special Olympics Haiti unified soccer team. It’s a big joy and honor to be part of that team. I will do my best to help the athletes in the USA Games Orlando 2022.”
Soccer was slated to be played throughout the week, although the schedule of individual matches was not specifically listed on the event’s website.
Haiti’s Special Olympics team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.
