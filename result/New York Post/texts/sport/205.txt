Given the drama of the past few weeks, you’d think that the sports action would be thin on the ground, but you’d be wrong! There’s still much action to look forward to as we reach the summer’s climax. 
MLS season is in full swing and the two teams in the Empire State are flying. The teams faced each other in the US Open Cup last week, where the Red Bulls prevailed 3-0. NYCFC are on the round this weekend, taking on Philadelphia Union. The Citizens drew 1-1 with the Rapids last time out, and are just a point clear of their city rivals.

The Red Bulls have been scoring for fun lately, notching 12 goals in their last four games. They’ll face LAFC on Sunday, who sit top of the Western Conference. Gerhard Struber’s men will be hoping to avoid defeat to keep in touch with NYCFC, but know they are up against it against a strong LAFC side. 
New York Mets are still sitting pretty on top of the NL East, with 45 wins to their name. They began a three game series against the Marlins on Friday, travelling down to Florida for the weekend. The Yankees have a league high 52 wins, giving their fans hope of a first championship since 2009. 
Fresh off a dynamite UFC Austin Fight Night card, the UFC returns to the APEX center for UFC Vegas 57. Given the fantastic fights that seem to dominate the cards that take place in front of a live audience, one can’t help but feel a bit down the action is going back to the isolation created by the APEX.
The main event sees Arman Tsarukyan take on Mateusz Gamrot, with Neil Magny vs. Shavkat Rakhmonov the pick of the rest of the card. 
21+. Available in AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN LA, MI, NJ, NY, TN, VA, WV only. Full T&C apply.
