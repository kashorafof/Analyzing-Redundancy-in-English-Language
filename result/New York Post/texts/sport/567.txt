A 16-year-old boy was arrested this week in connection to the shooting death of a 35-year-old man during a high-end jewelry robbery outside an Upper Manhattan hot spot last year, authorities said. 
The teen is the second person linked to the death of Jeffrey Sanchez – who was blasted in the torso outside Opus Lounge on 10th Avenue near West 203rd Street in Inwood around 4:10 a.m. Sept. 20, cops said. 
The teen – whose name was not released because of his age – was arrested at his home Wednesday and charged with murder, robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and assault, police said late Thursday. 
Sanchez – who was targeted for his Cartier watch – was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital, police said. 
Another man, 42, was also shot in the right forearm, cops said. He was taken to Harlem Hospital in stable condition. 
Police said they are probing whether the deadly shooting is linked to the high-end robbery ring known as OED – or Own Every Dollar – that has terrorized patrons of Big Apple hotspots for their pricey jewelry. 
Back in December, Damian Suarez, 19, was also arrested in connection to Sanchez’s death and charged with murder and robbery, cops said.
