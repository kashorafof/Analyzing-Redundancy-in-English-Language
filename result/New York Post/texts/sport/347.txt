Everyone fantasizes about being able to hop on a plane and just go on a spontaneous vacation, but what if you could actually do that. Maybe soon you should pull out that old suitcase and get ready to hit the road. If you’re itching to travel, it might be time to join Dollar Flight Club. 
With DFC Plus+ Lifetime Subscription, you can save up to $2,000 on Business, Premium Economy, & Economy Class Flight Deals, and for a limited time it’s only $99 (Reg. $1690). Plus, if you purchase DFC Premium Plus+ between June 15th and June 30th, you’ll get five entries for a chance to win a $5,000 travel giveaway toward flights, hotels, food, adventures, and more. That could be your whole vacation budget! 
Planning a vacation is stressful, and that stress is typically focused on finances. It’s expensive just getting where you want to go, not to mention the cost of hotels and restaurants. Dollar Flight Club helps you “travel more cheaply and in a timely manner when and where [you] want,” as one reviewer puts it. Users have scored roundtrip flights to Madrid for $300, to Panama for $439, and even Hawaii for only $129.
Just select your home airports, and DFC will send you deals on domestic, international, and mistake fares. Your phone will be filled with flight deals found for you, so you don’t have to search for them yourself. If you see a flight somewhere you like, grab it and start planning that next trip. 
And speaking of planning your next trip, it would probably be a lot easier with $5,000 added to your budget. Purchasing Dollar Flight club between the 14th and 30th of June gives you five entries to win the big Travel Getaway. That’s a thousand dollars more than the average cost of a two-week vacation!
Let your vacation plans take off. Hop on a plane with Dollar Flight Club Premium Plus+ Lifetime Subscription on sale for $99 (Reg. $1690) and get five chances to win $5k!
