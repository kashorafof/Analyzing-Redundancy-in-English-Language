Americans deeply disapprove of President Biden’s handling of the economy, inflation and soaring gas prices – and say those three issues will dictate how they will vote in the midterm elections this fall when control of Congress is at stake, a poll released Sunday shows. 
More than eight in 10 Americans – 83% – cite the economy as an extremely or very important issue in determining how they will cast their vote in November, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll. 
And 80% say inflation, which is hovering around 40 year highs, and 74% say gas prices, which are nearing $5 a gallon, are important factors about how they will vote. 
Only 37% approve of Biden’s response to the economy, while even smaller margins approve of his handling of inflation (28%) and gas prices (27%).
Even among Democrats, Biden manages only to eke out majorities on inflation (56%) and gas prices (51%).
In even more dire news for Democrats, Republicans hold a substantial advantage in their motivation to vote – 57% of Republicans say they are very enthusiastic, compared to 44% of Democrats. 
The only positive approval rating Biden gets is from his response to the coronavirus pandemic – 56% approve, 43% disapprove.
On a range of other issues, he remains underwater: immigration 61% disapprove, 37% approve; the economic recovery, 61%-37%; crime, 61%-38%; Russia/Ukraine war, 52%-46%; climate change, 55%-43%; inflation, 71%-28%; gas prices, 72%-27%; abortion, 58%-41%.
Asked to rank which single issue they think is the most important this November, 21% say inflation, 19% say the economy, 17% say gun violence, 12% say abortion. 
The remainder come in at single digits, including 8% gas prices, 6% immigration, 5% climate change, 3% crime, COVID 2%  and Russia and taxes are tied at 1%.
The poll surveyed 542 adults between June 3-4. 
It has a plus/minus 4.8 percentage points margin of error.
