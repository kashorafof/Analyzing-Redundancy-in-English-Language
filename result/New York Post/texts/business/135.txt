Investing money in the stock market isn’t just for the people who are already millionaires.  Find the right entry point into investing, and your money can start bringing in its own salary. And the biggest secret? Investing in the stock market isn’t hard to manage if you have the right tools. Tykr Stock Screener is a popular app for people new to the stock market. It makes your first investments manageable and for a limited time, the Pro Plan Lifetime Subscription is on sale for $119 (Reg. $900). 
Tykr is the investment app that beginners in the stock market are raving about. “Tykr is so easy to use and demystifies the investment process for newbies and more experienced investors alike. I now have a lot more confidence in committing to my investment portfolio based on the financial clarity that Tykr provides. I can also mitigate my risk much more effectively,” writes one Trustpilot reviewer. 

Investing money always has some degree of optimism, but Tykr takes out as much of the guesswork as possible. From one screen, you can get a summary of stocks with an analysis of their potential, a score for a stock’s investment potential, and a breakdown of how much you could earn by investing. 
All you need is a browser and an entrepreneurial spirit and you can start investing with minimal risk. Tykr supports trading for over 30,000 US and international stocks, and it even teaches you as you use it. Start small and become a stock market pro with a diverse portfolio and income to prove it. 
If you’re a new investor, you aren’t locked out of the stock market. Even if you only have one dollar to put down, you can still start earning with Tykr. Manage your investments, grow your portfolio, and become a trading master. Maybe someday soon you can spend your days golfing instead of at your job.
