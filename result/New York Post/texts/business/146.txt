It’s going to be a one busy summer for Gen Z and millennials.
A new survey by OnePoll and Mattress Firm asked 2,000 Americans about their summer plans, and two in three participants said they’re going to be the busiest they’ve ever been. 
In fact, 67 percent of Gen Z respondents and 65 percent of millennials have overbooked themselves, with 68 percent of participants RSVPing to almost every event they’re invited to this season. 
In fact, on the average person’s calendar already are three weddings, three birthday parties and three family vacations, among other events. 
While respondents know what they’re signing up for. 62 percent know they’re going to be exhausted from their travels. However, 73 percent feel like they’ll get better sleep in hotels. In fact, 75% of respondents said they feel more refreshed than usual waking up away from home.
Luckily for Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber — who just launched skincare lines — 37 percent of respondents prioritize following their beauty routine before bed more so on vacation than at home (32 percent).
