You love your pets, but that doesn’t mean you have to love every smell they introduce you to. Having an odor-eliminating air purifier could be the answer. The VentiFresh ECO PLUS helps break down harmful particles in the air using NASA-inspired technology. This personal air purifier for pet owners is on sale for a limited time at only $65 (Reg. $88). 
Get that litter box funk out of the air and say goodbye to other unpleasant smells around the house. The VentiFresh takes down bad smells and keeps them away using three layers of protection. The Photocatalyst layer is inspired by NASA’s own technology and breaks down germs where other air fresheners just cover them. A UV-C light then helps sterilize microorganisms before a UB-A light takes out bacteria and germs. 
One Amazon reviewer writes, “This tiny thing was amazing, it eliminated the smell of our cat box and worked for over 2 years without slowing down…”
The VentiFresh started on Indiegogo, where it raised 388% of its funding goals, and it’s easy to see why. You can finally eliminate all those funky pet scents without spraying something into the air that will harm your pets or risk a house fire. Plug it in with a USB cable and enjoy as your home starts to smell a little less animal-like. These odor eliminators don’t make a lot of noise, and even have a Quiet Mode. Or, if your furry friend is a little gassy, you can turn on Turbo Mode.
Eliminate pet odor safely for you and your fur baby. For a limited time, get the VentiFresh ECO PLUS: Next-Gen Odor Eliminator (Oakwood) on sale for $65 (Reg. $88). Get the 2-pack for $126.
