Police in Florida have released heartbreaking video of a severely neglected dog that was apparently thrown over a fence at a rescue facility, where it has undergone emergency surgery.
“We’re looking for the heartless owners who left this dog on the morning of June 8th at the Tri-County Animal Rescue in Boca Raton,” the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office said on Twitter.
“The dog could barely stand, let alone walk. Parker had to have emergency surgery. We’re asking for your help. This is animal cruelty,” the agency added, using the name it gave the poor Shih Tzu.
The harrowing video shows the weak pup’s face hidden by knotted, dirty hair and his body missing large sections of fur. He was neither microchipped nor collared before being dumped.
A volunteer at Tri-County Animal Rescue found the abandoned pooch along the fence line on the north side of the building Wednesday morning, WPLG reported.
Parker had apparently been thrown over the fence because the gated facility is locked, according to the outlet.

As of early Friday, the approximately 6-year-old pooch was recovering at the facility and listed in guarded condition after the surgery.
“This is disgusting! How could anyone do this to an animal? God only knows how they treat humans!?!? I doubt much better,” one user said on Twitter in response to the heart-rending video.
“So glad he’s safe now and in excellent hands!! Speedy recovery, little guy!!” the person added.
Another user added, “This is absolutely disgusting and extremely cruel!! 
“Does ACC have any cameras outside of the building anywhere?? I sure hope the low life is found and punished!! They should never be allowed to have any pets ever again!” 
Anyone with information about the heinous crime is asked to call Crime Stoppers of Palm Beach County at 1-800-458-8477.
