This is purportedly the quantum mechanics of optical illusions. 
Thought last week’s cat puzzle was im-paw-ssible to crack? Social media is blowing a collective gasket trying to figure out yet another viral, animal-based optical illusion that reportedly only 1 percent of people can solve. 
“Only 1 percent of people can find the second animal in this image,” declares illusion connoisseur @pasillusion in a viral video detailing the corneal calculus.  
The accompanying mind-melting image shows a dolphin eating a fish with a ship in the distance and seemingly no other fauna in sight. 
But the visual jigsaw stumped puzzlers on social media with many mistakenly thinking the fish was the second animal. 

Can YOU See The Hidden Animal?! Let me know! #illusion #animal #viral #fyp
However, critter number two is actually a bird — multiple birds, actually. To see them, per the clip, users need simply flip their phone upside down, whereupon Flipper eating a fish in the waves becomes a flock of birds flying over the ocean. 
Specifically, the dolphin’s inverted tail and head form two different birds with its head evoking a pelican flying with a fish in its mouth and the water splashes resembling the tips of its wings. Meanwhile, the rest of the flock is comprised of the upside-down white caps of the ocean.
