The clock’s run out on this counterfeit scheme.
Federal authorities seized hundreds of fake luxury watches that, if real, would have been valued at more than $22.5 million, US Customs and Border Protection announced Monday.
A package of 584 fraudulent Rolex and Cartier watches was intercepted by CBP officers in Louisville on Thursday, according to the agency. The shipment was sent from Hong Kong and destined for Jamaica, Queens.
“Consumers are always looking for the best deal, the unfortunate part is criminals are also online pedaling their counterfeit products,” Louisville’s Port Director Thomas Mahn said in a statement. “Our CBP officers will continue to seize counterfeit items that threaten the safety and health of consumers and weaken the U.S. economy.”

The watches and other counterfeit goods are typically sold in underground outlets and on third-party websites that help fund smugglers and organized crime members, according to CBP.
Both Cartier and Rolexes can cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“Our officers are dedicated to protecting private industry and consumers by removing these kinds of shipments from our commerce,” Director of Field Operations in Chicago LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke said in a statement.  
The seizure was one of many to happen Thursday, according to CBP. Another shipment of six Richard Mille watches valued at $755,000, if real, was also scooped by the feds. 
No arrests were announced by the border patrol agency.
