A new species of giant water lily has been discovered by scientists - and itâs been hiding in plain sight for 177 years.
The huge plant had been in the archives of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew - and was growing in a number of aquatic collections - but it was mistakenly identified as another species.
It also holds the record as the largest water lily, with leaves growing more than 3m (10ft) wide.
