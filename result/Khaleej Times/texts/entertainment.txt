Standing tall at just over two feet, Jyoti Amge has a big smile and a bigger personality to match her Guinness World Record title of being the shortest woman alive. Hailing from Nagpur, Maharashtra, Jyoti was born on December 16, 1993, and her growth was of average stature until she reached the age of five. It later emerged that she has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia and would never grow beyond a certain height. In 2009, Guinness World Records confirmed Jyoti to be the world's shortest teenager living (female) at 61.95 cm (2 ft). Two years later, on her 18th birthday, Jyoti was measured again. She was 62.8 cm (2 ft 0.72 in), confirming her as the world's new shortest female living (mobile). Now aged 28, Jyoti has retained her record for over a decade and broken a second as the world's shortest actress, after appearing in American Horror Story: Freak Show. Here are 14 instances when our world looked enormous in contrast with Jyoti's: 1. Holding a microphone In 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jyoti collaborated with the Nagpur Police department to bring about awareness. She reminded people to wash their hands regularly and wear facemasks when they leave home. She helped the police communicate their message of how important it was for the public to stay at home. 2. With a baby Standing at just over two feet, Jyoti is shorter than an average two-year-old. She looks especially small when with children and babies, although she loves being around them. 3. Sitting on a chair with world’s shortest man In 2010, Jyoti met Khagendra Thapa Magar, the shortest living teenager (male) at the same time Jyoti was the shortest living teenager (female). Khagendra went on to become the shortest male living (mobile), before sadly passing away in 2020, aged 27. 4. Standing next to pigeons This encounter with pigeons occurred in 2011, when Jyoti was in Italy filming the fifth season of Lo Show Dei Record. From her perspective, these pigeons were rather large birds. 5. With her family When Jyoti is with her family, she is often held or carried around so she can see the world from their point of view. At home she performs lot of chores and often helps with preparing meals, making hot drinks and cleaning. Having the support of her family is a big source of Jyoti’s strength and sunny outlook, although she hasn’t always felt so positive about her condition. 6. Holding a can of soda An average 330cl canned drink is 11.52 cm (4.5 in) tall, but looks much larger against Jyoti's small frame. 7. Attending class Jyoti has completed her undergraduate degree, as well as a Masters degree in English Literature. She has also taken acting and dance classes. But attending college was a challenge for Jyoti. She needed her sister to attend college with her, in order to carry her from A to B. It also didn’t help that one of her classes was on the top floor and, with no lift, Jyoti needed her sister’s assistance there too. 8. Trying on someone's glasses In 2010, when she was still the shortest living teenager (female), Jyoti appeared on the third series of the Japanese TV show Amazing People. One of the hosts gave her his glasses to try on, which of course were far too big for Jyoti’s petite face. 9. Holding a Guinness World Records book This image of Jyoti holding the Guinness World Records book is from a 2012 photoshoot promoting the launch of Guinness World Records 2013. The book is 30.3 cm (11.9 in) tall, roughly half of Jyoti’s total height. 10. Holding a coffee cup An average coffee cup, like the one on the counter in this image, has a height of approximately 9.5 cm (3.74 in). Jyoti would require both hands to lift a full cup of this size. 11. Comparing hands This image clearly puts into perspective just how difficult it must be for Jyoti to perform everyday tasks or use things designed for average-sized hands. 12. Posing with Sultan Kösen In 2018, the shortest and tallest met in Egypt. Sultan, who is 251 cm (8 ft 2.8 in) tall, is four times taller than Jyoti. Their size difference is so great that the length of Sultan’s feet is more than Jyoti’s height.

But nothing can top off a good sizzler steak with exceptional service —  and this is exactly what Mumbai’s popular restaurant, Yoko Sizzlers, has been doing in the UAE for over two-and-a-half decades. As you walk into Yoko’s, you’re greeted by the sound of steaks sizzling on hot iron plates, a smoky aroma filling up your nostrils (in a good way, of course), and a space with a simple, but functional layout. Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

A heavy sandstorm in Iraq forced the closure of some state schools and offices and halted flights at Baghdad International Airport. Other countries, including Saudi Arabia, have issued dust storm alerts as well.
But nothing can top off a good sizzler steak with exceptional service —  and this is exactly what Mumbai’s popular restaurant, Yoko Sizzlers, has been doing in the UAE for over two-and-a-half decades. As you walk into Yoko’s, you’re greeted by the sound of steaks sizzling on hot iron plates, a smoky aroma filling up your nostrils (in a good way, of course), and a space with a simple, but functional layout. Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

But nothing can top off a good sizzler steak with exceptional service —  and this is exactly what Mumbai’s popular restaurant, Yoko Sizzlers, has been doing in the UAE for over two-and-a-half decades. As you walk into Yoko’s, you’re greeted by the sound of steaks sizzling on hot iron plates, a smoky aroma filling up your nostrils (in a good way, of course), and a space with a simple, but functional layout. Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

As you walk into Yoko’s, you’re greeted by the sound of steaks sizzling on hot iron plates, a smoky aroma filling up your nostrils (in a good way, of course), and a space with a simple, but functional layout. Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies. For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us. Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie. To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking. Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice. The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place. We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table. Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful. So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?

Standing tall at just over two feet, Jyoti Amge has a big smile and a bigger personality to match her Guinness World Record title of being the shortest woman alive.
Hailing from Nagpur, Maharashtra, Jyoti was born on December 16, 1993, and her growth was of average stature until she reached the age of five. It later emerged that she has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia and would never grow beyond a certain height.
In 2009, Guinness World Records confirmed Jyoti to be the world's shortest teenager living (female) at 61.95 cm (2 ft). Two years later, on her 18th birthday, Jyoti was measured again. She was 62.8 cm (2 ft 0.72 in), confirming her as the world's new shortest female living (mobile).
Now aged 28, Jyoti has retained her record for over a decade and broken a second as the world's shortest actress, after appearing in American Horror Story: Freak Show.
Here are 14 instances when our world looked enormous in contrast with Jyoti's:
1. Holding a microphone
In 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jyoti collaborated with the Nagpur Police department to bring about awareness. She reminded people to wash their hands regularly and wear facemasks when they leave home.
She helped the police communicate their message of how important it was for the public to stay at home.
2. With a baby
Standing at just over two feet, Jyoti is shorter than an average two-year-old. She looks especially small when with children and babies, although she loves being around them.
3. Sitting on a chair with world’s shortest man
In 2010, Jyoti met Khagendra Thapa Magar, the shortest living teenager (male) at the same time Jyoti was the shortest living teenager (female).
Khagendra went on to become the shortest male living (mobile), before sadly passing away in 2020, aged 27.
4. Standing next to pigeons
This encounter with pigeons occurred in 2011, when Jyoti was in Italy filming the fifth season of Lo Show Dei Record. From her perspective, these pigeons were rather large birds.
5. With her family
When Jyoti is with her family, she is often held or carried around so she can see the world from their point of view. At home she performs lot of chores and often helps with preparing meals, making hot drinks and cleaning.
Having the support of her family is a big source of Jyoti’s strength and sunny outlook, although she hasn’t always felt so positive about her condition.
6. Holding a can of soda
An average 330cl canned drink is 11.52 cm (4.5 in) tall, but looks much larger against Jyoti's small frame.
7. Attending class
Jyoti has completed her undergraduate degree, as well as a Masters degree in English Literature. She has also taken acting and dance classes.
But attending college was a challenge for Jyoti. She needed her sister to attend college with her, in order to carry her from A to B. It also didn’t help that one of her classes was on the top floor and, with no lift, Jyoti needed her sister’s assistance there too.
8. Trying on someone's glasses
In 2010, when she was still the shortest living teenager (female), Jyoti appeared on the third series of the Japanese TV show Amazing People.
One of the hosts gave her his glasses to try on, which of course were far too big for Jyoti’s petite face.
9. Holding a Guinness World Records book
This image of Jyoti holding the Guinness World Records book is from a 2012 photoshoot promoting the launch of Guinness World Records 2013. The book is 30.3 cm (11.9 in) tall, roughly half of Jyoti’s total height.
10. Holding a coffee cup
An average coffee cup, like the one on the counter in this image, has a height of approximately 9.5 cm (3.74 in). Jyoti would require both hands to lift a full cup of this size.
11. Comparing hands
This image clearly puts into perspective just how difficult it must be for Jyoti to perform everyday tasks or use things designed for average-sized hands.
12. Posing with Sultan Kösen
In 2018, the shortest and tallest met in Egypt. Sultan, who is 251 cm (8 ft 2.8 in) tall, is four times taller than Jyoti. Their size difference is so great that the length of Sultan’s feet is more than Jyoti’s height.

But nothing can top off a good sizzler steak with exceptional service —  and this is exactly what Mumbai’s popular restaurant, Yoko Sizzlers, has been doing in the UAE for over two-and-a-half decades.
As you walk into Yoko’s, you’re greeted by the sound of steaks sizzling on hot iron plates, a smoky aroma filling up your nostrils (in a good way, of course), and a space with a simple, but functional layout.
Yoko, which first rolled up its shutters in Dubai in 1998, offers a wide range of dishes like beef, chicken and even vegetarian sizzlers that can be coupled with a variety of soups, mocktails, salads, and desserts as well as some Chinese delicacies.
For starters, we were offered an onion soup topped with cheese, which served as a good indication of the meaty offerings that lay ahead of us.
Next up, the chefs spun us a variety of mouth-watering steaks, including a  Beefsteak Sizzler, Schezwan Chicken Sizzler, and even a sizzling Choco Brownie.
To be honest, there’s no way you could go through a sizzler all by yourself, unless you have an appetite that rivals Jughead’s. Yoko’s portions were meaty and generous and would easily suffice for two people. The marination was just the way we wanted it and the meat was also grilled to our liking.
Each sizzler comes with a base and sides of fries or mashed potatoes, vegetables and noodles or buttered rice. The beef steaks are topped with dollops of garlic pepper, spicy schezwan or mushroom sauce, or any other topping of your choice.
The Schezwan Chicken Steak was a nice variation. We found the fusion between the continental and Chinese styles perfectly balanced. The sauce can be a tad spicy and pungent, but it worked for us. Moreover, the staff are always at hand to guide you through your order, in case you’re new to the place.
We also tried their Chilly Prawns which was an Indo-Chinese variation. Juicy, large size prawns tossed in a sweet, sour and hot sauce, accompanied by a bowl of noodles is perfect for any occasion or meal of the day. We would have enjoyed this dish much more if it wasn’t for the sizzlers ‘smoking’ right in front of us on the table.
Desserts have always been a favourite, and the Sizzling Brownie left us thoroughly satisfied. Hot, melting chocolate sauce poured over rich vanilla ice cream on a base of brownies, we just couldn’t stop at a few spoonfuls. It was divine! The hot, cold and sweet combination was irresistibly delightful.
So what will take us back to Yoko’s? Generous portions combined with signature taste and courteous service; oh, and did I mention meaty offerings?
Where: Yoko Sizzlers, Karama or Al Nahda
Meal for two: About Dh250 for three courses

American actor Alexis Bledel will not return for Season 5 of The Handmaid’s Tale.
“After much thought, I felt I had to step away from The Handmaid’s Tale at this time," Bledel, who has played Emily/Ofglen on the Hulu drama since its first season began in 2017, said in a statement Friday. “I am forever grateful to Bruce Miller for writing such truthful and resonant scenes for Emily, and to Hulu, MGM, the cast and crew for their support," she said, as reported by Variety.
Bledel garnered four Emmy nominations and one victory for her role in the Bruce Miller-created TV version of Margaret Atwood’s renowned novel The Handmaid’s Tale during her four-year tenure.
Apart from The Handmaid’s Tale, Bledel is best known for her roles in Gilmore Girls, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants franchise as well as Mad Men.
The Handmaid’s Tale, which will air its fourth season from April to June 2021, follows June (Elisabeth Moss) as she fights the totalitarian regime Gilead as a powerful rebel commander, but the risks she takes lead to unforeseen and frightening new obstacles. Her desire for vengeance and justice threatens to overtake her and damage her most important relationships.
Emily, an escaped handmaid and refugee in Canada who was known as Ofglen when still under Gilead’s authority, was last seen in The Handmaid’s Tale Season 4 finale, where her character joins forces with June and other former handmaids to exact revenge on Gilead.

A leading rare-book dealer from London is presenting an exceptional private collection of Sir Richard Francis Burton — a famed British explorer of Arabia, Asia and Africa — and his wife, Isabel Lady Burton, at the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair.
The £2 million (Dh9.2 million) collection of Burton’s works, formed by Loren and Frances Rothschild, is composed of autograph manuscripts and letters, presentation copies, inscribed and annotated works, drawings, photographs, printed books, pamphlets, and articles, amounting to several hundred autograph pages and almost 200 printed works.
Pom Harrington, owner of rare book dealer Peter Harrington, described in detail the new catalogue of 125 items titled Abu Dhabi 2022, which exhibits works spanning centuries and continents.
So, there is a first edition of Burton’s ‘Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah’ – an extraordinary account of his visit to the holiest of Muslim places: Makkah and Madinah, which is on display in a fine set of three volumes in bright-blue gilt-lettered original cloth.
“Obviously, Sir Burton went there in disguise as it’s forbidden place for non-Muslims,” Pom told Khaleej Times, and noted the classical travel literature surpassed all preceding Western accounts of the two holy cities of Islam.
Another rare book is ‘Trucial States’, a manuscript journal of a British Navy officer’s tour of the Gulf. The unpublished archive of journals documents the Middle East in the early 1930s, including a richly detailed first-hand account of a visit to Dubai and a reception on-board the HMS Effingham of the Trucial Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Fujairah, Ajman, Sharjah, Ras Al-Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain.
“The officer was 19-year-old acting sub-lieutenant Wyatt R. Larken. The accounts of the Sheikhs’ visit and their reactions are very interesting. In the 1930s, the Gulf was very important for the British.”
Pom said the collection provides a vivid picture of life in the Middle East in the early and mid-20th century.
“While the prolific accounts and celebrated works of Burton and other famous explorers such as T.E. Lawrence are infinitely collectable, we are pleased to also include an expanded selection of unusually rare and uncommon works that offer a fresh perspective in understanding and appreciating the region’s rich and complex history.”
Other unique works on show include ‘Alf Layla Wa-Layla’ (One Thousand and One Nights), an exceptionally rare first edition in Arabic; a rare and important map of Oman from 1874, which shows that Abu Dhabi was then called Abu Thebi and Dubai as Debay; a first edition of the biography of the great conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) by Ahmad Ibn ‘Arabshah’; first edition of Charles Darwin’s ‘On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection’; first edition of James Joyce’s ‘Ulysses’ – one of the 750 copies on handmade paper; the first and scarcest of the Harry Potter books: ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone’, among others on display.
The Fair runs at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) until Sunday.
