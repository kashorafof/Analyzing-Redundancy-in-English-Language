Every spring break, I get into this routine where I collect old clothes, old shoes, and gadgets that I am no longer using and send them off to a place which salvages what it can — and then the recycled stuff gets donated. It makes me happy that I am contributing my two-bit to the larger good.
With the pandemic and various stress points of life creeping in more often than one would want, a friend suggested I repeat the routine mentally. Initially, I was a bit sceptical, but, nevertheless, gave it a shot. I processed feelings, emotions, regrets and expectations. Many of them, I realised, had lived longer in my head than needed and deserved a quiet burial. Some emotions were harder to pack away but, with time, it’s a routine I have created.
Thoughts — bitter ones sometimes — that would buzz in my head needed to be chopped off and sent away packing. Expectations were toned down and I reminded myself of what Louisa May Alcott once wrote: “Into each life some rain must fall, some days must be dark and sad and dreary.”
But I was also curious how others dealt with these mental dragons. Mj Maria Uy Lami-in, a Filipina expat, has been living in the UAE for 15 years now; she works as a socio-civic HR consultant, among other jobs. When asked about how she usually de-stresses, she says, “Stress is usually any outside factor that we let in to affect and get to us — that is if we let it in, and to what degree. I might not have the
conventional answer most would want to hear but I keep busy outside of what’s ‘affecting’ me. I keep my mind and body active with something more pressing, preferably not my current issues.”
Some will say it’s avoidance, but, for her, it’s a temporary rerouting and regrouping of her mental and physical energies until she gets the strength and mental capacity to face and deal with her actual stressor. “It might not be very practical as per some professionals, but it works for me. A good blow dry helps.
Look good, feel good still stands true. It’s not being fake. It’s a step towards self-care. You already feel horrible inside, why wallow in it on the outside?”
An upside of current times is that we are discussing mental health issues more often — and more candidly — these days. Mj Maria points out that the issue of mental health and ‘being’ in that place has always been present. “What has changed is the shift of what is now openly acceptable in our social mindset. It is now more accepted and acceptable, we are even expected to talk about mental health and one’s own mental wellbeing, much like all the other currently ‘socially relevant issues’ of the last decade or so.”
On how to keep regrets and expectations in check, she points out, “Hope for the best, expect the worst. I know that sounds fatalistic but with recent global events, we’ve come to a point wherein our priorities and mindsets have shifted. And mine certainly has. I have come to that age and maturity where I am more appreciative and immensely grateful everyday of what I have been given in life and survived and manifesting graces.
Yes, it’s great to expect and dream of great things but we also need to have that practical and realistic balance of life realities so we don’t get dismayed and disappointed over false expectations.”
When asked that one size never fits all so how is an individual expected to deal with these pressures on their own, Mj Maria says, “There is no right or wrong answer I guess, even though some would push more for what they believe in. Depending on who is vocal, more visible and gets it out there. There was a time in my life I was easily rattled; on career, relationships, finances and people’s opinions. I felt so alone and very scared. But I kept it all inside because of generational social expectations and pressure. I guess I might be of one of the last generation wherein we were conditioned to keep ‘our mess, our perceived weaknesses in’. To keep a brave and strong face for everyone else except ourselves because that is how it was done. I was even afraid to ask for help or open up. We were conditioned to be that way.”
Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the biggest success stories to have come out of Hollywood, while speaking to Rolling Stone, said that his anxiety comes from the small things, the “really stupid stuff, things that shouldn’t make you anxious whatsoever. It’s crazy how your mind will become this database to make you worry about things that are so arbitrary. I have a well-organized life, and I’ve put a lot of thought into the things that I do, and then, you know, my stomach will be... I’ll just be sitting there, totally anxious about something ridiculous. You have to stop yourself during the day and say, ‘It’s just not worth it’.”
In London, Priya Chandan has developed her own way of dealing with dark thoughts and seeking a bright, safe place in the sun. Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, today she calls London — where she has now lived for 16 years with her husband, three kids and their pet dog — her home
After Priya had her third child, she decided to take up something that would allow her to find a purpose in her life. “I came across a foundation course in counselling and here I am, four years later, doing my Level 4 diploma in integrative counselling.” She calls herself a self-love and self-care advocate, and truly believes in taking care of herself first because “you can’t pour from an empty cup”. “My first priority in life is my family and if I struggle and burn myself out, I will not be able to give my family the love and the affection that I so very much would love to shower them with.”
Mental health has recently become the hot topic perhaps because of the realisation now that mental health is not just about mental wellbeing but it also includes physical wellbeing, emotional well-being, social wellbeing — basically, your overall wellbeing. “Ever since the pandemic struck, with lockdowns and isolations, losing our loved ones to the virus and so much more, everyone was forced to slow down the pace of their lives, to reflect and take that reality check which was long overdue,” she feels.
“People were forced to re-evaluate their pre-pandemic life,” Priya adds. “Somewhere, I believe it eventually dawned on people that it was actually a burnout from the hustle and bustle of life. It gave us a fresh perspective of how we can ‘live’ the gift of life rather than just existing. In my opinion, it has given people a fresh lease to build a life of conscious choices. Choices that add value to this new life and for this very reason, it’s important that one nurtures and replenishes their own cup of self-care.”
In order to walk the talk, Priya has built her own customised, go-to self-care tool kit whenever she feels overwhelmed. “I am aware one size never fits all. Everyone has their own way of dealing with things but you can make your own kit with anything that you truly enjoy doing when you are feeling stressed or burnt out.”
So, what’s in her self-care tool kit? “Long walks that help me regulate my emotions. Nature is therapeutic, it is soul healing. Sometimes driving helps me too. Music and podcasts distract me from over-thinking. Speaking to family and friends helps me calm my mind. Journaling is one of the best tools of my survival kit: pouring out my thoughts and feelings on a note pad has been a game changer. You do not need to save these if you are worried someone might read them: you can write your thoughts on paper, and then shred it or even burn it. Anything that’s bothering you — let it out of your system, on to the paper and let it go. Crying is one of the best self-soothing mechanisms that helps uplift my mood. Crying is not a sign that you are too sensitive or weak. Crying releases toxins and stress hormones which help restore our emotional balance and soothe the soul.”
Priya also suggests keeping one hour of the day — or even just 20 minutes — to spend time with just yourself, sit with your feelings and reacquaint yourself with the new you.
Ahmed Mohammed Younis, a quality engineer in the UAE, has his own unique way of coping with stress. “Stress can cause severe mental pressure in many ways. When it comes to me, I try my best to address and overcome this by identifying what stressed me out exactly and find answers as to why this is affecting me. This helps me in finding positive actions of what to do next to de-stress. Moreover, I do things that help me: getting busy with my friends and talking about positive things that can motivate me, going to the gym and working out… also, [looking for] food online plays a big role in overcoming stress for me!” Ahmed says.
Stress cannot be avoided completely, so we must try and find coping mechanisms, and zero in on proper solutions on how to deal with them in a healthy and productive way. “We need to be easier on ourselves too. Fortunately, now there are many professionals who can help us seek positive life changes with tools suited to us. Sometimes we are our own worst critic. We have to learn to be kinder to ourselves and accept challenges in life as a learning process,” is how he sums up his life lessons.
Stress is here to stay, and as we manage our careers and relationships — with their attendant good, bad and ugly sides — our main survival tool has to be accepting that stress and demons do live in our mind spaces. But it’s more important to talk about them and, at times, seek a helping hand so we can declutter our minds and hearts of negativity.

Preparing for mass shootings is a small part of what school police officers do, but local experts say the preparation for officers assigned to schools in Texas — including mandatory active shooter training — provides them with as solid a foundation as any.
"The tactical, conceptual mindset is definitely there in Texas," said Joe McKenna, deputy superintendent for the Comal school district in Texas and a former assistant director at the state's school safety centre.
A gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School on Tuesday. As students called 911, officers waited more than an hour to breach the classroom after following the gunman into the building. The district's police chief, Pete Arredondo, decided officers should wait to confront the gunman on the belief he was barricaded inside adjoining classrooms and children were no longer at risk, officials said Friday.
"It was the wrong decision," Steven McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a news conference Friday.
A group of Border Patrol tactical officers would later engage in a shootout with the gunman and kill him, officials said. Arredondo could not immediately be reached for comment Friday by the AP.
Across the country, police officers who work in schools are tasked with keeping tabs on who's coming and going, working on building trust so students feel comfortable coming to them with problems, teaching anti-substance abuse programs and, occasionally, making arrests.
The police department for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District says on its website that its primary goal is "to maintain a safe and secure environment for our future leaders to learn and our current leaders to educate while forming partnerships with students, teachers, parents, and the community while enforcing laws and reducing fears."
The active-shooter training was mandated by state lawmakers in 2019 in response to school shootings. Under state law, school districts also are required to have plans to respond to active shooters in their emergency response procedures.
Security can sometimes become lax because school officials and officers may not believe a shooting will ever happen in their building, said Lynelle Sparks, a school police officer in Hillsboro, Texas, and executive director of the Texas Association of School Resource Officers.
"It's always making sure that you are prepared," she said. "People get relaxed. It happens in every district. You can't say that it doesn't. It happens everywhere. We get to the point, 'Oh my gosh. This is horrific. Safety Safety Safety.' The school year goes by, 'Oh, why do I have to lock my door everyday, you know? I wish that every teacher would teach behind a locked door. It doesn't make it a prison system. It's about saving lives."
Under the incident command approach that was widely adopted after 9/11, it is unsurprising that the school police chief would be considered the commander, even following the arrival of officers from other agencies, McKenna said. The designated person would be considered the commander until relieved by a higher-ranking officer, but that doesn't necessarily happen immediately when efforts to save lives are continuing, he said.
"Obviously it's still an ongoing investigation, but it would make sense that a police chief of a school district would be the initial incident commander," McKenna said.

Ukrainian officials warned that their forces wouldn’t be able to stop the Russian offensive without more sophisticated Western-supplied weaponry.
The fighting Friday focused on two key cities: Sievierodonetsk and nearby Lysychansk. They are the last areas under Ukrainian control in Luhansk, one of two provinces that make up the Donbas and where Russia-backed separatists have already controlled some territory for eight years. Authorities say 1,500 people in Sievierodonetsk have already died since the fighting’s start scarcely more than three months ago. Russia-backed rebels also said they’d taken the railway hub of Lyman.
The governor of Luhansk warned that Ukrainian soldiers may have to retreat from Sievierodonetsk to avoid being surrounded. But he predicted an ultimate Ukrainian victory. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days, as analysts predict,” Serhiy Haidai wrote on Telegram on Friday. “We will have enough forces and means to defend ourselves.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnskyy also struck a defiant tone. In his nightly video address Friday, he said: “If the occupiers think that Lyman or Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian.”
For now, Sievierodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk told The Associated Press that “the city is being systematically destroyed — 90% of the buildings in the city are damaged.”
Striuk described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of the battle for Mariupol, located in the Donbas’ other province, Donetsk. Now in ruins, the port city was constantly barraged by Russian forces in a nearly three-month siege that ended last week when Russia claimed its capture. More than 20,000 of its civilians are feared dead.
Before the fighting, Sievierodonetsk was home to around 100,000 people. About 12,000 to 13,000 remain in the city, Striuk said, huddled in shelters and largely cut off from the rest of Ukraine. At least 1,500 people have died there because of the fighting, now in its 93rd day. The figure includes people killed by shelling or in fires caused by Russian missile strikes, as well as those who died from shrapnel wounds, untreated diseases, a lack of medicine or being trapped under rubble, the mayor said.
In the city’s northeastern quarter, Russian reconnaissance and sabotage groups tried to capture the Mir Hotel and the area around it, Striuk said.
Hints of Russia’s strategy for the Donbas can be found in Mariupol, where Moscow is consolidating its control through measures including state-controlled broadcast programming and overhauled school curricula, according to an analysis from the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.
Gen. Phillip Breedlove, former head of US European Command for NATO, said Friday during a panel mounted by the Washington-based Middle East Institute that Russia appears to have “once again adjusted its objectives, and fearfully now it seems that they are trying to consolidate and enforce the land that they have rather than focus on expanding it.”
Ukrainian analysts said Russian forces have taken advantage of delays in Western arms shipments to step up their offensive there.
That aggressive push could backfire, however, by seriously depleting Russia’s arsenal. Echoing an assessment from the British Defense Ministry, military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Russia was deploying 50-year-old T-62 tanks, “which means that the second army of the world has run out of modernized equipment.”
Russia-backed rebels said Friday that they had taken over Lyman, Donetsk’s large railway hub north of two more key cities still under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych acknowledged the loss Thursday night, though a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesperson reported Friday that its soldiers countered Russian attempts to completely push them out.

In the media, it’s mostly stories of sibling rivalry — and bitter falling outs — that topline news. With precedents set by the likes of Mary and Anne Boleyn, Liam and Noel Gallagher, Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine, Julia and Eric Roberts, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, who needs a sibling love story?
I’d once read a line somewhere that stayed with me. “Just because you’re related to your brother or sister doesn’t mean you have to like them.” So, if there was an immediate family member you had to say “I don’t have to like you” to, an overwhelming number would zero in on a sibling. Not a parent, not a son/daughter, not a grandchild. Come to think of it, it would not even be a friend you can tell this to — because friends are the family you choose to like, right?
My own relationship with my brother is a fairly complex one. We basically ignored each other till we became adults; growing up, I thought he was weird and left it that, wasn’t worth my while (or so I thought) to work around it, and he pretty much felt the same about me. We grew closer only after we started living in different cities, well after life threw us a few curveballs. We are still close, though there is a fine line that stops me from assuming we are “alike”, because we are not. And I can’t take him for granted, so I have to work hard: I had to make an effort with his partner at a time when I didn’t know her too well; I have to hear out his concerns about our father — even though I find them slightly exasperating most of the time; and, often, I lie to him about stuff I believe in because I know he wouldn’t “approve”.
It all adds up to one thing. Sibling relationships are hard work. Nothing is unconditional about them, because they are all about give and take.
And that’s what makes them fascinating.
To commemorate Brothers and Sisters Day this coming Tuesday, we delved into the complexities of the sibling code and came up with some gems.
‘We still fight a lot even though we don’t share a room anymore’
Dr Maria Waqar, social scientist based in Houston
“I have two sisters. The younger, Saliha, is two years younger than me, and the youngest, my baby sister Faryal, is 16 years younger. Growing up, Saliha and I literally shared a room for the longest time, and when our parents went through a divorce, we sought each other out, and kept each other grounded. We were really young when they got divorced, but I never felt insecure or lost because I always had my sister. Having said that, siblings can be really mean and cruel, so, yes, we fought a lot. And we still fight a lot even though we don’t live in the same room anymore, I live in the US and she lives in Pakistan [where she’s a banker], and we have very different lives.
Sometimes we fail to relate to each other, because we have very different perspectives on life. At times, it becomes toxic, which is when we realise we need to stop fighting like we did when we were children… it’s not sustainable… That realisation is important to ensure a relationship does not disintegrate.
With my youngest sister, it’s a different dynamic because she’s always been a baby for me. She’s now a graduate, and I really make a conscious effort to not infantilise her any more. She’s an adult and she can do whatever she wants even if I don’t approve of it. It’s difficult, sure, but whoever said life is easy?”
‘If you don’t constantly work on the relationship, friends can take the place of siblings sometimes’
Justin Harper, freelance writer based in Dubai
“In Singapore, where I spent a lot of time, when Lee Kuan Yew [the founding father] died, his sons fought over a bungalow that he owned — it became a public affair and it was really embarrassing, one of them was the Prime Minister at the time. I get upset when I see people like the Ambani brothers falling out — two super wealthy businessmen who want to outdo one another…
The flashpoints of sibling conflict are usually when money or inheritance comes into the picture … or when your brother or sister gets married… or [the difference between] how you bring up your kids, and how they bring up their kids… these can really muddy the waters… As long as it’s a direct relationship between you and your sibling, it’s fine I guess, but the moment there are other factors, it may be a problem.
My philosophy has always been to keep everyone happy, and I definitely never want to fall out over money! How would I handle it? We’ll work it out so we get an equal share, even if I stand to lose some amount. As for the matter of siblings’ spouses/partners, my take is even if you don’t like them much, even if you find them annoying, your sibling loves them — so that should be good enough for you, as they would want you to treat their partner the same way as you treat them.
I have two sons, about three years apart: Will and Freddie, 14 and 11, and they have probably inherited my super competitive streak, and they take on each other in sports, studies… My wife is of Sri Lankan origin, a ‘tiger mum’ with Asian values of pushing them academically. At times, we wonder if this kind of sibling rivalry is ‘healthy’, but then I see my sons together when they don’t know we are ‘spying’ on them… I observe how much they need each other… that’s when I see their real sibling bond... I see that from afar and feel quite jealous. I have two sisters, but, growing up in the UK in the 70s and 80s, they weren’t particularly interested to ‘compete’ with boys and so we didn’t spend a lot of time together.
When I grew up, it was about getting the right dynamics in place, and sometimes that can be hard work. My sisters live in the UK, I’ve been living overseas, and I see them for a few days in a year, I would tend to gloss over grudges and bad feelings… Life’s too short — and my sisters, luckily, feel likewise.
If I compare my own sibling relationships with what my sons share, the irony is that you may assume full-grown adults, in their 40s and 50s, will be different from 12- and 14-year-olds… but you see similar rifts appear, and you realise you are arguing about some of the same issues!
We need to constantly work at it, put in the maintenance to keep it going. Because if you don’t, friends can take the place of siblings sometimes. That’s something that wouldn’t happen with your parents, because, unlike siblings, you cannot find their surrogates as easily.”
‘The hardest part about being twins is that not everything is equal’
Morgan and Alexandra Venison, co-founders of branding/communications agency Genii & Co
“For us, the best part about being siblings — and twins! — is that we may have an argument, which can be horrible and personal, since we know so much about each other, but in an hour — or maximum a day — we’re back to being best friends. And at the end of it, we know we’ll always be there for one another, even if, at times, we are really harsh and say things to each other we wouldn’t tell our spouses or boyfriends or friends: with them, we probably wouldn’t be able to get away with it, but with each other, we can.
There’s ‘unconditional love’, but that’s accrued with a lot of effort. We resolved to ensure we would not have a fractured relationship. We actioned it, talked about it a lot, and actively worked on it.
The hardest part about being twins — and we guess pretty much the same rule applies for siblings per se — is that not everything is equal. There was a time in our younger years when we drifted apart for a while, we felt we had an identity crisis and needed to seek our own identities… and then we came back.
And then, when we were in our mid-20s, Morgan got really sick — and that was an eye-opener even though it was horrible. That actually got us together and [made us] become best friends.
Although we are twins and we work together, we are clear about our separate identities: one of us is a dyed blonde, the other’s a brunette [laugh], we have separate groups of friends. But what to do if either one of us is dating someone who doesn’t like my sister? Simple: he doesn’t stand a chance, he’s out [laugh].
Us joining forces to become business partners was very much the result of the industry changing… We spotted an opportunity, and put our skills (PR and journalism) together to make money.
How we click as an A-team? We were both raised a certain way, we both have the same aspirations and goals, and we both know how hard the other one works. The business lessons you learn when you work together are actually what you learnt growing up with that person. Compromise is factored into our relationship because, in our subconscious, we are so used to it.
Trust — implicit trust —  is another huge factor. We know how well we balance one another out. At times, one of us is having a bad time, the other is on a level playing field, so that person needs to get the other off the edge — this is also a throwback to our younger years.
There are stress lines, yes. We tend to take out a lot of stuff on each other as we can be totally vulnerable [with each other]. Often, there’s judgement drawn — but it’s actually good to have someone judging you because you may need to be given a reality check once in a while.”
‘Does it make sense to give up on a relationship over money or property?’
Melwyn Abraham, director, Matrix Consulting, Dubai
“I am the eldest sibling; my second brother Nelson, who I wasn’t particularly close to while growing up, is five years younger than me; the youngest, Oscar, 10 younger than me, I was phenomenally close to — I was almost like a father figure to him. But as I grew older, I started getting close to Nel, and he was the best man at my wedding. Oscar turned out the smartest of us all, and there’s been a role reversal: I go to him for advice these days!
Nel migrated to Australia four years ago, but we are in touch all the time, and meet up whenever we can; Oscar, like me, is in Dubai. Our wives get along really well, and we are all godparents to each other’s kids.
Sounds like a dream, right? How did it turn out so well? We made a conscious decision to not let external factors — even parents or spouses — affect our relationship. It was a conversation that took place when Nel married out of faith and he came to me for support, and we decided, then and there, whatever happens, at the end of the day, we’ll support each other no matter what. Oscar was still pretty young back then, he was in college, and we got him up to speed soon enough.
So, yes, differences of opinion do pop up once in a while but we have a bond that ensures we overcome them. Given the amazing relationship we have, it pains me when I see rifts tearing apart siblings — especially if they are part of the extended family.”
Oscar Abraham, corporate lawyer based in Dubai
“When I was studying [for a law degree] in India, my teachers in law school would take on cases in family courts. Many cases that came up had to do with non-equitable distribution of inheritance that would lead to a breakdown of sibling relationships. Even extended families would take sides… and, ultimately, these would never end well.
It’s hard to judge that kind of a situation from the outside: does it make sense to give up on a relationship over money or property? Well, I wouldn’t know till I’m in those shoes.
Our parents set a clear template: they would only be responsible for us till the time we ended our education — and from thereon, it was expected that we would, individually, manage on our own, tread our own path… not fight over inheritance.
Growing up, our understanding of sibling ties was framed by our eco-system: my mother had seven siblings, my dad three. They were very close. And we believed this is what sibling relationships should be like.
I mean, there are siblings who are estranged, we’ve seen this within our extended family and friends’ circle… two siblings wouldn’t even be in the same room. Fortunately, all three of us have made conscious efforts to keep our closeness going and not let time and distance affect it. It’s important to let our kids share the same kind of relationship we [brothers] share, so we do Zoom calls as often as possible, and try and meet up somewhere once every year. All of us together.”

With the Capital making rapid progress in bone marrow transplants for children, the request for treatment abroad would drop by 50 per cent in the next two years, said a top official from Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Centre (ADSCC).
“Abu Dhabi is currently distinguished by the application of the highest standards used in the treatment of bone marrow transplantation, which are followed in the latest medical centres abroad,” said Dr Fatima Al Kaabi, Director, the Abu Dhabi Bone Marrow Transplant Programme (AD-BMT) at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Centre.
It was in July 2020 that ADSCC inaugurated the AD-BMT programme with the UAE’s first-ever successful procedure on a patient with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer.
Though cancer is the third-highest cause of death in the UAE, citizens and residents had often sought treatment abroad for cell therapy and regenerative medicine in previous years. But in April 2021, the first Emirati patient benefited from the programme.
“By providing these distinguished services in the country makes it easier for us as specialists in this field to provide medical care for the cases that you need while staying in the family environment and providing psychological support in addition to reducing costs compared to treatment abroad,” she said during the first Emirates Paediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Congress in Abu Dhabi.
In April this year, Burjeel Medical City performed the country’s first paediatric bone marrow transplant from a donor to a child. And the latest success was the UAE’s first BMT for a child with thalassemia performed in Abu Dhabi on a three-year-old boy from Iraq.
“We expect, during the next two years, with the presence of bone marrow transplants for children, to reduce the request for treatment abroad for these cases to 50 per cent,” Dr Fatima added.
Dr Shamsheer Vayalil, chairman and managing director, VPS Healthcare, said with treatment available at home, it will reduce the medical bills for residents who, till date, sought expensive care abroad, which in some cases could hit $1 million.

“The conference and the theme are a critical and timely one as it highlights the significant improvements in the care and delivery of therapies for some of the complex diseases afflicting children around the world,” he said.
