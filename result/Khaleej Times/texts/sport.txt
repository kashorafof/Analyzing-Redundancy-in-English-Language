Published: Fri 20 May 2022, 9:18 AM Finding a genuine - and we mean it by the word genuine - all-rounder in the world of mobiles can be very difficult task. So when we unboxed the HONOR X9 and reviewed all the way to the end, we went through the checklist twice. So many times in the past, models have come trying to upsell as flagship phones when they are not. And there are phones which will compromise on many things to make it fit in a certain price bracket. The HONOR X9 is affordable and yet comes out unflinchingly well - not just on its build quality but for the features inside as well. We got to review the HONOR X9 with 8GB+2GB RAM and 128GB memory. There is also a 256GB version available. Here are X things that we liked. For all its efficiency in handling whatever was thrown at it, some highlighted as below, the most impressive part of the HONOR X9 was that it hardly broke into a sweat. An industry-leading 66W SuperCharge battery, with a capacity of 4,800mAh, drives the long-lasting power horse to navigate all the challenges Without gaming, the battery lasted nearly 3 days. Even with it, it took two days before it was time to take out the 66W charging brick from the box. And it takes only 43 minutes for a full charge; that is 81% in half an hour. In the 20 minutes that I had a shave and shower, the phone went up from 4 to 70%. At 6.81 inches long, this one is a tall beauty. The HONOR X9 comes in two colours - the premium looking Titanium Silver, and the regal Midnight Black, which we got. At the back is a circular camera tray with three lenses and the flash placed in symmetrical fashion. The singular sim tray, type-C charging port and the microphone are placed at the bottom. On the side is the volume rocker and a fingerprint sensor for your right thumb. The front real estate is where it matters most. The IPS LCD display has a resolution of 2388x1080 with 120Hz refresh rate and 385 ppi density. Watching your screen for long for your share of entertainment and gaming will not become a chore with the HONOR X9. The bezel is barely over 1mm thickness to add to the display values. Let's cut to the chase. Powering your multimedia needs as well as the official ones is the Snapdragon 695 octacore 6nm 5G chipset and the Adreno 619 CPU. It can handle up to 35 apps simultaneously. So what happens when it comes to gaming. Well, the HONOR X9 can chip in with an extra 2GB RAM Turbo boost, so you can increase it to 10GB RAM on demand. Pioneers of the Turbo GPU technology, the HONOR offering in the X9 ensures smooth running of intense action whether it is Fortnight, PUBG or Minecraft. Even while gaming and handling up to 20 apps in a heavy demanding situation, the phone held its ground. Beyond its looks and the hardware, the whole setup comes together in a body as rigid as the Himalayas. The mountains may be too high, but drop the phone from a tall table height or sending it sliding away from waist level to the ground - the HONOR X9 will not break; or even get into much scratch either. It can withstand your body weight up to 70kg and temperatures ranging from -20°C to 55°C. There's the 16MP selfie camera that sits near the top of the display, right in the center. Turning around the back, in the halo-shaped tray, a 48MP shooter with f/1.8 aperture takes the pride of placing. There are two 2.4MP macro and bokeh cameras that enable super macro and portrait shots respectively. For the Vloggers, there is a dual front and back live view feature. The setup delivers well even in low light. HONOR is taking their cameras seriously. Even then, photos taken in night mode tend to be overexposed. We tried it at a restaurant and notice the difference below the tables. With the night mode on (right), the exposure was just about right without going overboard on the light meter. Even though a wide-angle camera is missing, life is good. The HONOR X9 comes with Android 11 out-of-the-box and its inbuilt Magic UI 4.2 Launcher. And the best thing about it is that it comes with Google Mobile Services. Google products are back on this device. Playing PUBG with a Turbo GPU was a breeze with the refresh rate and effectively 10GB of RAM. As for the Antutu 3D benchmark, the HONOR X9 scored 391339 points on the review device. It missed the 400k mark just a little bit but the overall gaming performance is really good. With all the results and considering how much of features are similar to a flagship phone, you would think that the HONOR X9 does not come cheap. But you would be pleasantly surprised when you find out the price In the UAE, our review version comes for AED 1,099 while the 256GB version starts AED 1,199. Given its price and capabilities and the 6nm 5G chipset powering the HONOR X9, it is a rare match of meeting beauty and brawn. The HONOR X9 is a genuine all-rounder and a treat to have.

Every spring break, I get into this routine where I collect old clothes, old shoes, and gadgets that I am no longer using and send them off to a place which salvages what it can — and then the recycled stuff gets donated. It makes me happy that I am contributing my two-bit to the larger good. With the pandemic and various stress points of life creeping in more often than one would want, a friend suggested I repeat the routine mentally. Initially, I was a bit sceptical, but, nevertheless, gave it a shot. I processed feelings, emotions, regrets and expectations. Many of them, I realised, had lived longer in my head than needed and deserved a quiet burial. Some emotions were harder to pack away but, with time, it’s a routine I have created. Thoughts — bitter ones sometimes — that would buzz in my head needed to be chopped off and sent away packing. Expectations were toned down and I reminded myself of what Louisa May Alcott once wrote: “Into each life some rain must fall, some days must be dark and sad and dreary.” But I was also curious how others dealt with these mental dragons. Mj Maria Uy Lami-in, a Filipina expat, has been living in the UAE for 15 years now; she works as a socio-civic HR consultant, among other jobs. When asked about how she usually de-stresses, she says, “Stress is usually any outside factor that we let in to affect and get to us — that is if we let it in, and to what degree. I might not have the conventional answer most would want to hear but I keep busy outside of what’s ‘affecting’ me. I keep my mind and body active with something more pressing, preferably not my current issues.” Some will say it’s avoidance, but, for her, it’s a temporary rerouting and regrouping of her mental and physical energies until she gets the strength and mental capacity to face and deal with her actual stressor. “It might not be very practical as per some professionals, but it works for me. A good blow dry helps. Look good, feel good still stands true. It’s not being fake. It’s a step towards self-care. You already feel horrible inside, why wallow in it on the outside?” An upside of current times is that we are discussing mental health issues more often — and more candidly — these days. Mj Maria points out that the issue of mental health and ‘being’ in that place has always been present. “What has changed is the shift of what is now openly acceptable in our social mindset. It is now more accepted and acceptable, we are even expected to talk about mental health and one’s own mental wellbeing, much like all the other currently ‘socially relevant issues’ of the last decade or so.” On how to keep regrets and expectations in check, she points out, “Hope for the best, expect the worst. I know that sounds fatalistic but with recent global events, we’ve come to a point wherein our priorities and mindsets have shifted. And mine certainly has. I have come to that age and maturity where I am more appreciative and immensely grateful everyday of what I have been given in life and survived and manifesting graces. Yes, it’s great to expect and dream of great things but we also need to have that practical and realistic balance of life realities so we don’t get dismayed and disappointed over false expectations.” When asked that one size never fits all so how is an individual expected to deal with these pressures on their own, Mj Maria says, “There is no right or wrong answer I guess, even though some would push more for what they believe in. Depending on who is vocal, more visible and gets it out there. There was a time in my life I was easily rattled; on career, relationships, finances and people’s opinions. I felt so alone and very scared. But I kept it all inside because of generational social expectations and pressure. I guess I might be of one of the last generation wherein we were conditioned to keep ‘our mess, our perceived weaknesses in’. To keep a brave and strong face for everyone else except ourselves because that is how it was done. I was even afraid to ask for help or open up. We were conditioned to be that way.” Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the biggest success stories to have come out of Hollywood, while speaking to Rolling Stone, said that his anxiety comes from the small things, the “really stupid stuff, things that shouldn’t make you anxious whatsoever. It’s crazy how your mind will become this database to make you worry about things that are so arbitrary. I have a well-organized life, and I’ve put a lot of thought into the things that I do, and then, you know, my stomach will be... I’ll just be sitting there, totally anxious about something ridiculous. You have to stop yourself during the day and say, ‘It’s just not worth it’.” In London, Priya Chandan has developed her own way of dealing with dark thoughts and seeking a bright, safe place in the sun. Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, today she calls London — where she has now lived for 16 years with her husband, three kids and their pet dog — her home After Priya had her third child, she decided to take up something that would allow her to find a purpose in her life. “I came across a foundation course in counselling and here I am, four years later, doing my Level 4 diploma in integrative counselling.” She calls herself a self-love and self-care advocate, and truly believes in taking care of herself first because “you can’t pour from an empty cup”. “My first priority in life is my family and if I struggle and burn myself out, I will not be able to give my family the love and the affection that I so very much would love to shower them with.” Mental health has recently become the hot topic perhaps because of the realisation now that mental health is not just about mental wellbeing but it also includes physical wellbeing, emotional well-being, social wellbeing — basically, your overall wellbeing. “Ever since the pandemic struck, with lockdowns and isolations, losing our loved ones to the virus and so much more, everyone was forced to slow down the pace of their lives, to reflect and take that reality check which was long overdue,” she feels. “People were forced to re-evaluate their pre-pandemic life,” Priya adds. “Somewhere, I believe it eventually dawned on people that it was actually a burnout from the hustle and bustle of life. It gave us a fresh perspective of how we can ‘live’ the gift of life rather than just existing. In my opinion, it has given people a fresh lease to build a life of conscious choices. Choices that add value to this new life and for this very reason, it’s important that one nurtures and replenishes their own cup of self-care.” In order to walk the talk, Priya has built her own customised, go-to self-care tool kit whenever she feels overwhelmed. “I am aware one size never fits all. Everyone has their own way of dealing with things but you can make your own kit with anything that you truly enjoy doing when you are feeling stressed or burnt out.” So, what’s in her self-care tool kit? “Long walks that help me regulate my emotions. Nature is therapeutic, it is soul healing. Sometimes driving helps me too. Music and podcasts distract me from over-thinking. Speaking to family and friends helps me calm my mind. Journaling is one of the best tools of my survival kit: pouring out my thoughts and feelings on a note pad has been a game changer. You do not need to save these if you are worried someone might read them: you can write your thoughts on paper, and then shred it or even burn it. Anything that’s bothering you — let it out of your system, on to the paper and let it go. Crying is one of the best self-soothing mechanisms that helps uplift my mood. Crying is not a sign that you are too sensitive or weak. Crying releases toxins and stress hormones which help restore our emotional balance and soothe the soul.” Priya also suggests keeping one hour of the day — or even just 20 minutes — to spend time with just yourself, sit with your feelings and reacquaint yourself with the new you. Ahmed Mohammed Younis, a quality engineer in the UAE, has his own unique way of coping with stress. “Stress can cause severe mental pressure in many ways. When it comes to me, I try my best to address and overcome this by identifying what stressed me out exactly and find answers as to why this is affecting me. This helps me in finding positive actions of what to do next to de-stress. Moreover, I do things that help me: getting busy with my friends and talking about positive things that can motivate me, going to the gym and working out… also, [looking for] food online plays a big role in overcoming stress for me!” Ahmed says. Stress cannot be avoided completely, so we must try and find coping mechanisms, and zero in on proper solutions on how to deal with them in a healthy and productive way. “We need to be easier on ourselves too. Fortunately, now there are many professionals who can help us seek positive life changes with tools suited to us. Sometimes we are our own worst critic. We have to learn to be kinder to ourselves and accept challenges in life as a learning process,” is how he sums up his life lessons. Stress is here to stay, and as we manage our careers and relationships — with their attendant good, bad and ugly sides — our main survival tool has to be accepting that stress and demons do live in our mind spaces. But it’s more important to talk about them and, at times, seek a helping hand so we can declutter our minds and hearts of negativity.

A California woman who punched a Southwest Airlines flight attendant in the face during a flight, breaking her teeth, has been sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. The federal judge also ordered Vyvianna Quinonez Tuesday in San Diego to pay nearly $26,000 (Dh95,000) in restitution and a $7,500 (Dh27,500) fine for the assault on May 23, 2021, Southwest flight between Sacramento and San Diego. The 29-year-old Sacramento woman is prohibited from flying for three years while she is on supervised release and must participate in anger management classes or counselling. Quinonez last year pleaded guilty to one count of interference with flight crew members and attendants, admitting she punched the flight attendant in the face and head with a closed fist and grabbed her hair. Neither she nor her attorney could be reached for comment Tuesday. During the flight's final descent, the attendant had asked Quinonez to buckle her seat belt, stow her tray table, and put on her facemask properly. Instead, Quinonez began recording the attendant on her cellphone, pushed her, then stood up and punched the woman in the face and grabbed her hair before other passengers intervened, authorities said. The assault was recorded on another passenger's cellphone. The plea agreement said that the flight attendant suffered three chipped teeth, two of which needed crowns, along with bruises and a cut under her left eye that needed stitches. "Attacks on flight crew members, who perform vital jobs to ensure passenger safety, will not be tolerated," U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman said in a statement after the sentencing. FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy said the sentence should "send a very strong message to air travellers — the FBI will vigorously pursue anyone who assaults or interferes with flight crews."

Finding a genuine - and we mean it by the word genuine - all-rounder in the world of mobiles can be very difficult task. So when we unboxed the HONOR X9 and reviewed all the way to the end, we went through the checklist twice.
So many times in the past, models have come trying to upsell as flagship phones when they are not. And there are phones which will compromise on many things to make it fit in a certain price bracket. The HONOR X9 is affordable and yet comes out unflinchingly well - not just on its build quality but for the features inside as well.
We got to review the HONOR X9 with 8GB+2GB RAM and 128GB memory. There is also a 256GB version available. Here are X things that we liked.
For all its efficiency in handling whatever was thrown at it, some highlighted as below, the most impressive part of the HONOR X9 was that it hardly broke into a sweat. An industry-leading 66W SuperCharge battery, with a capacity of 4,800mAh, drives the long-lasting power horse to navigate all the challenges Without gaming, the battery lasted nearly 3 days. Even with it, it took two days before it was time to take out the 66W charging brick from the box. And it takes only 43 minutes for a full charge; that is 81% in half an hour. In the 20 minutes that I had a shave and shower, the phone went up from 4 to 70%.
At 6.81 inches long, this one is a tall beauty. The HONOR X9 comes in two colours - the premium looking Titanium Silver, and the regal Midnight Black, which we got. At the back is a circular camera tray with three lenses and the flash placed in symmetrical fashion. The singular sim tray, type-C charging port and the microphone are placed at the bottom. On the side is the volume rocker and a fingerprint sensor for your right thumb.
The front real estate is where it matters most. The IPS LCD display has a resolution of 2388x1080 with 120Hz refresh rate and 385 ppi density. Watching your screen for long for your share of entertainment and gaming will not become a chore with the HONOR X9. The bezel is barely over 1mm thickness to add to the display values.
Let's cut to the chase. Powering your multimedia needs as well as the official ones is the Snapdragon 695 octacore 6nm 5G chipset and the Adreno 619 CPU. It can handle up to 35 apps simultaneously. So what happens when it comes to gaming. Well, the HONOR X9 can chip in with an extra 2GB RAM Turbo boost, so you can increase it to 10GB RAM on demand. Pioneers of the Turbo GPU technology, the HONOR offering in the X9 ensures smooth running of intense action whether it is Fortnight, PUBG or Minecraft. Even while gaming and handling up to 20 apps in a heavy demanding situation, the phone held its ground.
Beyond its looks and the hardware, the whole setup comes together in a body as rigid as the Himalayas. The mountains may be too high, but drop the phone from a tall table height or sending it sliding away from waist level to the ground - the HONOR X9 will not break; or even get into much scratch either. It can withstand your body weight up to 70kg and temperatures ranging from -20°C to 55°C.
There's the 16MP selfie camera that sits near the top of the display, right in the center. Turning around the back, in the halo-shaped tray, a 48MP shooter with f/1.8 aperture takes the pride of placing. There are two 2.4MP macro and bokeh cameras that enable super macro and portrait shots respectively. For the Vloggers, there is a dual front and back live view feature. The setup delivers well even in low light. HONOR is taking their cameras seriously. Even then, photos taken in night mode tend to be overexposed. We tried it at a restaurant and notice the difference below the tables. With the night mode on (right), the exposure was just about right without going overboard on the light meter. Even though a wide-angle camera is missing, life is good.
The HONOR X9 comes with Android 11 out-of-the-box and its inbuilt Magic UI 4.2 Launcher. And the best thing about it is that it comes with Google Mobile Services. Google products are back on this device. Playing PUBG with a Turbo GPU was a breeze with the refresh rate and effectively 10GB of RAM. As for the Antutu 3D benchmark, the HONOR X9 scored 391339 points on the review device. It missed the 400k mark just a little bit but the overall gaming performance is really good.
With all the results and considering how much of features are similar to a flagship phone, you would think that the HONOR X9 does not come cheap. But you would be pleasantly surprised when you find out the price In the UAE, our review version comes for AED 1,099 while the 256GB version starts AED 1,199.
Given its price and capabilities and the 6nm 5G chipset powering the HONOR X9, it is a rare match of meeting beauty and brawn. The HONOR X9 is a genuine all-rounder and a treat to have.

A California woman who punched a Southwest Airlines flight attendant in the face during a flight, breaking her teeth, has been sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.
The federal judge also ordered Vyvianna Quinonez Tuesday in San Diego to pay nearly $26,000 (Dh95,000) in restitution and a $7,500 (Dh27,500) fine for the assault on May 23, 2021, Southwest flight between Sacramento and San Diego.
The 29-year-old Sacramento woman is prohibited from flying for three years while she is on supervised release and must participate in anger management classes or counselling.
Quinonez last year pleaded guilty to one count of interference with flight crew members and attendants, admitting she punched the flight attendant in the face and head with a closed fist and grabbed her hair. Neither she nor her attorney could be reached for comment Tuesday.
During the flight's final descent, the attendant had asked Quinonez to buckle her seat belt, stow her tray table, and put on her facemask properly.
Instead, Quinonez began recording the attendant on her cellphone, pushed her, then stood up and punched the woman in the face and grabbed her hair before other passengers intervened, authorities said.
The assault was recorded on another passenger's cellphone.
The plea agreement said that the flight attendant suffered three chipped teeth, two of which needed crowns, along with bruises and a cut under her left eye that needed stitches.
"Attacks on flight crew members, who perform vital jobs to ensure passenger safety, will not be tolerated," U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman said in a statement after the sentencing.
FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy said the sentence should "send a very strong message to air travellers — the FBI will vigorously pursue anyone who assaults or interferes with flight crews."

Symonds was killed in a single-vehicle accident in northern Queensland earlier this month, leaving Australian cricket reeling once more following the recent and unexpected deaths of greats Shane Warne and Rod Marsh.
Family, friends, fans and former teammates gathered to celebrate his life at a public memorial service at a stadium in the coastal city of Townsville, where he lived.
Former cricketers Ricky Ponting, Allan Border, Adam Gilchrist, Darren Lehmann and Ian Healy turned out for the man affectionately known as ‘Roy.’
It followed a private funeral where a cricket bat, fishing rod, crab pot and a number of hats were placed alongside the timber coffin, local media reported.
“The service was just simply beautiful. In its entirety, it was full of sadness, but just such wonderful beautiful memories of a guy that just gave so much of himself to so many people unconditionally,” Gilchrist told reporters.
“He was just a pure heart, found his way into trouble as well as anyone... loyal beyond belief.”
Symonds, who played 26 Tests and 198 One Day Internationals from 1998 to 2009, was considered one of the most skilled all-rounders Australian cricket has seen, bowling both off-spin and medium pace.
He also played many match-winning hands with his explosive middle-order batting and was a top-rate fielder who played a key part in Australia’s back-to-back 50-over World Cup triumphs in 2003 and 2007.
“Great bloke, great teammate,” said former Australia skipper Ponting, who selected Symonds for the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, where he scored a masterly 143 not out in their opening match.
“If I’m picking a team tomorrow in a Test match, one-dayer or a T20 he is in my team every day of the week.
“He would do anything if it meant saving one run or giving his mates a better chance of winning the game. You could say that about him every time he took the field.”
Domestically, Symonds played for Queensland for 17 seasons while appearing for Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire and Surrey in the English County Championship and for Deccan Chargers and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League.
After retiring he forged a successful career as a commentator.
“Andrew was a young teammate with a huge reputation,” said Healy, who was master of ceremony at the public memorial at Townsville’s Riverway Stadium.
“Supremely talented, a very hard worker,” he added. “But one who didn’t find first-class cricket immediately easy. So to see him ascend to the commentary box and then to master his analysis of broadcasting and cricket in general gave me a wonderful sense of pride.”

A Delhi-based writer Geetanjali Shree has become the first Indian writer to win the International Booker Prize.
Her novel titled Ret Samadhi, translated into English as Tomb of Sand by Daisy Rockwell, won the International Booker Prize.
It was the first Hindi-language book to be shortlisted for the PS50,000 prize.
“Congratulations to Geetanjali Shree and @shreedaisy who have been longlisted with Tomb of Sand: https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books/tomb-of-sand #2022InternationalBooker #TombofSand #GeetanjaliShree #DaisyRockwell@TiltedAxisPress,” The Booker Prizes said in a tweet.
It is a story set in the shadow of the partition of India, which follows an elderly woman after the death of her husband.
“Yessss! Translator Daisy Rockwell and author Geetanjali Shree win the International Booker for ‘Tomb of Sand’ (‘Ret Samadhi’ in the original). A first win for a Hindi novel, an Indian novel, a south Asian novel. Congratulations! @TheBookerPrizes,” Bengali writer Arunava Sinha tweeted.
Geetanjali Shree is the author of several short stories and novels.
Her 2000 novel Mai was shortlisted for the Crossword Book Award in 2001.

Swiatek, the 2020 champion, dropped serve three times against 95th-ranked Danka Kovinic of Montenegro before sealing a 6-3, 7-5 third round victory.
Kovinic recovered from 1-4 down in the second set to lead 5-4 but the Pole steadied with a hold and a break before serving out for victory.
“I wanted to play really aggressively but sometimes I felt I was hitting with too much power and it was hard to control,” said 20-year-old Swiatek.
Swiatek’s winning streak is the best on tour since Serena Williams’s 34 successive victories in 2013.
Swiatek next faces Chinese teenager Zheng Qinwen who made the last 16 on her debut when French veteran Alize Cornet, playing in her 61st consecutive Grand Slam, retired with a leg injury, trailing 6-0, 3-0 after just 44 minutes.
Having stunned 2018 champion Simona Halep in the second round, Zheng becomes only the fourth Chinese woman to make the last 16 in Paris where compatriot Li Na won her landmark Slam title in 2011.
“I did everything I had to do. I always knew I had the level to do well, now I just want to keep going,” said the 19-year-old Zheng, ranked at 74.
Cornet, the last Frenchwoman in the draw, was booed by a section of the Court Philippe Chatrier Court.
“It hurt more than my injury itself,” she said.
Spain’s Badosa, who made the quarterfinals in 2021, retired from her last 32 match due to a calf injury when she was trailing Russia’s Veronika Kudermetova 6-3, 2-1.
Sabalenka, the seventh seed, slipped to a 4-6, 6-1, 6-0 defeat to Italy’s Camila Giorgi who is into the fourth round for the first time.
The exits of Badosa and Sabalenka mean that for the first time in the Open era only one top 10 seed has survived to the fourth round.
In stark contrast, nine of the top 10 men are still in contention.
World No.2 Daniil Medvedev eased through by defeating Serbian 28th seed Miomir Kecmanovic 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.
Medvedev has not dropped a set in three rounds and will next play former US Open champion Marin Cilic who ended 37-year-old Gilles Simon’s 17-year-old Roland Garros career with a 6-0, 6-3, 6-2 win.
Cilic, who made back-to-back quarter-finals in 2017 and 2018, fired 42 winners.
Medvedev fell in the opening round on his first four trips to Paris before reaching the quarterfinals a year ago.
Fourth seed and 2021 runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas was equally untroubled, needing just 92 minutes to clinch a 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 win over Sweden’s 95th-ranked Mikael Ymer.
Greek star Tsitsipas had to come back from two sets down to beat Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti and then needed four hours and four sets to see off 134th-ranked qualifier Zdenek Kolar in his first two outings.
Rublev, also a quarterfinalist two years ago, defeated Chile’s Cristian Garin 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (13/11).
Garin saved three match points in the fourth set while Rublev saved five set points in the tiebreak.

Leclerc was joined on the front row by Spanish teammate Carlos Sainz, who was unable to complete his final lap after running into Mexican Sergio Perez’s crashed Red Bull with the cars blocking the track.
The red flags came out and the session was not resumed.
Perez, who had to go to the medical centre for checks after the session, ended up third with world championship-leading teammate Max Verstappen fourth on a tight street circuit where qualifying is crucial.
Only 10 times since 1950 has the showcase race been won by a driver starting lower than third, but Sunday’s weather forecast contains the risk of rain.
“It is very special. I’m so incredibly happy,” said Leclerc.
“It’s been a very smooth weekend until now. I knew the pace was in the car and I just had to do the job,” added the Monegasque, who was fastest in Friday practice and can regain the overall lead on Sunday.
“It went perfectly. That last lap before the red flag was really, really good. Anyway, it didn’t change anything for us. The car felt amazing and it’s great to have Carlos with me on the front row.”
The pole was Leclerc’s fifth in seven races so far this season and third in a row. He was also fastest in every phase of qualifying on Saturday.
His time of one minute 11.376 seconds was already comfortably quicker than his rivals, with Sainz 0.225 slower and Perez 0.253 off the pace.
We couldn’t have done that time.”
Leclerc is six points adrift of Verstappen in the standings after retiring with an engine problem while leading the previous race in Spain eventually won by his Dutch rival.
Leclerc took pole in Monaco last year after he suffered a late crash in qualifying, an accident that also brought out red flags, but he was unable to start the race due to a driveshaft failure.
The Ferrari driver has yet to score a point at home and is seeking to become the first Monegasque to do so since Louis Chiron finished third in 1950. Perez crashed at Portier, the right-hander before the tunnel, and Sainz was unable to avoid him as he swept around the corner.
“I had to hit the brakes and obviously try to avoid him the best I could,” said the Spaniard, who said there were no concerns about his car for the race.
“It’s a shame, another a year that a red flag costs us at the end of a session that we cannot go for pole position but this is typical Monaco.”
Lando Norris qualified fifth for McLaren, after shaking off the tonsillitis that affected him in Spain, and ahead of the Mercedes of fellow Briton George Russell.
Double world champion Fernando Alonso starts seventh for Renault-owned Alpine, despite also crashing in the final seconds, with seven-times champion Lewis Hamilton lining up eighth for Mercedes but more than a second off the pole time.
Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel qualified ninth for Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon 10th for Alpine.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo again struggled in his McLaren, qualifying 14th.
“It’s frustrating and just confusing to not make these natural steps that one should,” he said.
Yuki Tsunoda brought out surprise red flags in the first phase when he hit the barriers, with the AlphaTauri driver continuing back to the pits.
The stoppage wrecked the chances of team mate Pierre Gasly, however, with the Frenchman left with no time to get out of 17th place while Tsunoda returned to qualify 11th.
