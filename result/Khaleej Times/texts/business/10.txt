Monday, Jun 27, 2022 | Zul Qaadah 27, 1443 Published: Sun 5 Jun 2022, 12:23 PM Gold prices will be under pressure in the coming week after a strong US job report but global recession fears will limit the decline, say commodity analysts. The yellow metal gave up all its gains on Friday to trade near $1,850 per ounce in the immediate aftermath of the official US labour market report, which revealed 390,000 jobs being added in May, higher than expected. “The (jobs) data fuelled the expectations of an aggressive Federal Reserve tightening outlook which buoyed the treasury yields and dollar higher and weighed on gold. However, the unemployment rate came in higher at 3.6 per cent, above the expected rate of 3.5 per cent… As investors digest the information, it is likely to tame down the aggressive rate hike expectations, which should support the metal. Meanwhile, rate hike fears are being countered by recession fears limiting the metal's downside,” said Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer at Century Financial. Technically, he said, the metal is trading in a range of $1,830-$1,875, and only a break on either side will determine the next direction. Below $1,830, the next support is seen near $1,810. Globally, economists fear that some countries could slip into recession, especially after the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis. The International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva is worried those countries that have been weakened by the Covid-19 pandemic could slip into recession as they rely on imports from Russia for oil and food. Rashad Hajiyev, founder of RM Capital Consulting, said gold will reverse and trade back in the coming days after dropping below $1,860 per ounce. In the UAE, the Dubai Gold and Jewellery Group data showed 24K closing the week at Dh224.25 per gram, 22K at Dh210.5, 21K at Dh201.0 and 18K at Dh172.25. In the week ahead, Valecha sees 24K gold price will likely trade between Dh219 and Dh230. waheedabbas@khaleejtimes.com Markets Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.91 per cent to $115.17 per barrel Markets6 days ago Markets Spot gold was down 0.04 per cent at $1,838.45 per ounce as of 9.15am UAE time Markets6 days ago Markets The dollar index fell 0.30 per cent to 104.38 Markets1 week ago Markets Spot gold was trading at $1,842.76 per ounce at 9.30am UAE time, up 0.22 per cent Markets1 week ago Markets Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index slid 4.4 per cent, its biggest intraday fall since November 2021, as stocks fell across the board including oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which retreated four per cent Markets1 week ago Markets The south Asian nation currency is expected to remain under pressure as the greenback is in high demand in the market due to uncertainty over political and economic crises Markets1 week ago Markets Investors worry that Fed rate hike could have adverse effects on economic growth Markets1 week ago Markets The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent and was briefly down more than 900 points Markets1 week ago
