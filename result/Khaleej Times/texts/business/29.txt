The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (NCEMA) said in a statement that the targetted groups include frontliners, volunteers, residents, the elderly and individuals with chronic diseases whose health condition allows them to take the vaccine. Since it launched its mass jab drive in December 2020, the UAE has been among the most vaccinated countries on earth. As on June 1, the country had the highest share of vaccinated residents, according to Our World in Data. Multiple vaccine brands are offered for free across government and private healthcare centres. Free booster doses as due are given to eligible residents as well. As on June 1, over 24.92 million vaccine doses were administered, with a distribution rate of 251.98 per 100 people. In November last year, 100 per cent of eligible residents had received one dose of the vaccine. The country achieved the feat in less than a year after it launched its mass vaccination drive.
