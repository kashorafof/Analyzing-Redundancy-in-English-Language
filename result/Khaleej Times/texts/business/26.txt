In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MoFAIC) affirmed the UAE's firm rejection of all practices and behaviors that contradict moral and human values ​​and principles. The Ministry underscored the need to respect religious symbols and not violate them, as well as confront hate speech and violence. The Ministry also noted the importance of strengthening the shared international responsibility to spread the values ​​of tolerance and human coexistence while preventing any practices that would inflame the sentiment of followers of different religions. India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday suspended a spokesperson and expelled another official after insulting comments they made which led to an outcry in Arab countries. At least six Arab nations have lodged official protests against India, and Pakistan and Afghanistan also reacted strongly Monday. Qatar, Kuwait and Iran summoned India's ambassadors, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued statements of condemnation. Anger has poured out on social media, and calls for a boycott of Indian goods have surfaced in some Arab nations.
