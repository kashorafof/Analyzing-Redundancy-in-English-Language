Monday, Jun 27, 2022 | Zul Qaadah 27, 1443 Published: Mon 6 Jun 2022, 7:24 AM Zendaya dominated the MTV Movie and TV Awards on Sunday as her teen drama “Euphoria” and big-screen superhero blockbuster “Spider-Man: No Way Home” were voted best show and best movie respectively. The light-hearted awards, taking place at the start of the summer blockbuster season, are voted for online by the public, and underscored the huge popularity of the 25-year-old former Disney child star. Zendaya won best performance in a show for “Euphoria,” HBO’s often bleak and hard-hitting look at modern teen life, which also won offbeat awards for “best fight” and a new award for the best on-screen “hookup.” The MTV awards have long bestowed tongue-in-cheek “golden popcorn” statuettes for categories ranging from “best kiss” to “most frightened performance.” With obsessive fans encouraged to vote multiple times for their favourites, the awards tend to recognize mainstream and commercial hits with large and devoted social media followings. It was little surprise therefore that “Spider-Man: No Way Home” — by far the biggest box office hit since the pandemic — won best movie. The film has earned almost $1.9 billion worldwide, and is the third-biggest hit for domestic theatres ever. It also won best performance in a movie for Zendaya’s on-screen and real-life boyfriend Tom Holland, who plays the latest incarnation of the web slinging superhero — although neither attended the ceremony in Santa Monica, near Los Angeles, in person. Lending some A-list stardust to the room, Jennifer Lopez was presented a non-competitive “Generation Award.” She thanked “true love” before telling her fiance Ben Affleck “and everybody at home” that she was on her way back for dinner. Lopez also won best song, for “On My Way (Marry Me),” while 19-year-old multiple Grammy winner Olivia Rodrigo won best music documentary “Olivia Rodrigo: driving home 2 u.” Jack Black was also honored by MTV for his career on Sunday. The 52-year-old attempted an energetic entrance, somersaulting on stage to youthful cheers from the audience, before breathlessly calling for “a little blast of oxygen.” Daniel Radcliffe, who won best villain for adventure comedy “The Lost City,” joked that his British accent had made his evil turn a breeze. “This is a universally recognized accent of pure evil,” he said. “This is a voice that would kick a puppy or not give Oliver Twist more food. “I really should thank my parents most for just having the foresight, all those years ago, to have me be British, so that I could grow up sounding naturally evil enough to one day win this award.” Entertainment The Bollywood superstar is celebrating 30 years in the film industry  Entertainment2 days ago Entertainment Bale served as the Dark Knight in three films Entertainment2 days ago Entertainment Britney had cut ties with her family after the end of a nearly 14-year-long period of conservatorship Entertainment2 days ago Entertainment The jury had announced its verdict on June 1, largely siding with Depp after a sensational trial Entertainment2 days ago Entertainment The comedy drama starring Kiara Advani, Anil Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor is out now in the UAE Entertainment2 days ago Entertainment The comic actor was in Dubai earlier this month for a performance Entertainment3 days ago Entertainment The Argentinian film is a psychological thriller that puts the Biblical “an eye for an eye” under the lens Entertainment3 days ago Entertainment The graduates will showcase 12 intriguing couture collections Entertainment3 days ago
