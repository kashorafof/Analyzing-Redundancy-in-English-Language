South African-Australian documentary and portrait photographer, Chanel Irvine, first set out to document English summertime in 2019, a year after she moved to the UK.
Irvine captured moments of leisure in coastal towns and countryside villages from Kent to Devon, from Cornwall to Shropshire.
A small number of portraits have the subjects gazing directly into the camera, but the majority of the work is taken from a distance, documenting small summertime rituals and sweeping landscapes.
An English Summer by Chanel Irvine is published by Hoxton Mini Press.
