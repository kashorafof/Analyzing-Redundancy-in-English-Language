The Iraqi military's Joint Operations Command has circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri and the famous leaning al-Hadba minaret.
The military, and the US-led coalition supporting its offensive in the city, said Islamic State (IS) militants had blown up the historic landmark on Wednesday night as troops advanced on it. 
But IS said coalition aircraft had bombed the mosque.
