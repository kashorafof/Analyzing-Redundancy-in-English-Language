You come to understand what Jackie has at stake and has to lose by committing to this life with the Kennedys.
Liz Egan, an editor at the Book Review, is here to talk about Louis Bayard’s new novel, “Jackie & Me,” which imagines the life of the young Jacqueline Bouvier before she became Jackie Kennedy.
What Paula Byrne brings to the table is the distance of someone who was not a close intimate of hers, who was maybe less interested in sanding off some of her rough edges.
Matthew Schneier is here to talk about a new biography of the British novelist Barbara Pym. Plus, Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world. And Times critics Jennifer Szalai and Molly Young join me to talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. This is the Book Review Podcast. It’s June 17. I’m John Williams.
[MUSIC STOPS] Liz Egan joins me now. She’s an editor at the Book Review and also the curator of the Book Review’s Group Text column. Hi, Liz.
Hi, John. How are you?
I’m good. So you’re here to talk about your latest pick for Group Text, the June pick. And we should just say briefly up front for those who aren’t aware — you haven’t been on in a while — that the Group Text series is a book each month that you pick that you think is particularly well suited to book club discussion. Is that fair?
That is fair. And I usually include — I always include, along with my review, suggestions for further reading, and then a couple of questions to maybe kickstart your conversation with your book group about that particular book.
Right, so this is a real starter pack. There’s no excuse for people not to choose this for their book club by the time you’re done giving them the outline.
Definitely not. And in the case of my June pick, not only is it a really discussion-worthy book, but it’s also really fun. And I imagine a book group sitting outside with frosty glasses of rosé and having not just a deep conversation, but also a fun one.
You’ve picked a novel by a veteran novelist, Louis Bayard. This is his 10th book. Tell us about it.
This book is called “Jackie & Me.” And it is the story of the friendship between a real-life friend of J.F.K.‘s whose name was Lem Billings. He was a friend of John Kennedy’s from high school, and remained his friend, I believe, until his death. And Louis Bayard imagines the friendship that sprung up between Lem and Jackie before she married Jack.
So the book begins in the summer of 1951, when the two meet one another. And they become really fast friends, as J.F.K. is kind of becoming J.F.K. and running for office and laying the groundwork for his major political career. And he turns to Lem as sort of his fixer and his trusted adviser, and basically asks Lem to entertain Jackie.
This is rooted in reality, but Bayard runs with it and imagines conversations between Lem and Jackie and just shows this, on one hand, fabulous life of parties and museums and fun they had together, but also sets up this ticking clock where you come to understand what Jackie really has at stake and has to lose by committing to this life with the Kennedys. And that includes a career of her own and a private life, which she values deeply, and also fidelity. We come to understand that this relationship with Jack will involve some extracurricular activity on his part. And Lem becomes close to her and cares about her. And you see him feel very torn about how much to warn her about what she’s in store for.
You mentioned that the story is rooted in history. And I’m not sure if Bayard gives a sense of this anywhere in the book before or after he starts the proper story, but do you know how deeply rooted, and how close the relationship was, and also whether Lem actually functioned in life as this buffer figure?
He definitely did function in real life as a buffer figure. In fact, there’s another whole book written about the relationship between Jack and Lem. And in an author’s note, Bayard states — actually, it appears at the back of the book, which I thought was an interesting decision on his part. He does say this is entirely a work of fiction. But this person, Lem Billings, really did exist. And there’s been a fair amount written about him. But he’s obviously imagining — Bayard is imagining everything else and filling in the gaps.
I had never heard of Lem Billings before. His full name is Kirk LeMoyne Billings. He was gay at a time when, in the circle he ran in, it wasn’t really spoken about. And he was fiercely loyal to Jack. In my obsessive Googling of him, some have said he was in love with Jack. I’ll leave that to history. But he was really loyal to the Kennedy family, and very much a part of their gatherings, and served as this buffer between Jack and Jackie.
Bayard has written other books about presidential relationships, and has written other historical novels. What is your sense about— not the accuracy of this one per se— but just that feeling of how immersed do you feel in it, how much does it feel stage managed, the details, and how vivid is it?
I felt incredibly immersed in it, to the point where I kept forgetting that pieces of it were true. This really was a man running for Senate. This really was a young woman who had a kind of exciting career as a photographer and had ambitions of her own. He puts you right in that moment. And I should also say, even if you’re not somebody who particularly cares very much about the Kennedys, it’s a great story. I feel like in many relationships, there’s kind of a third wheel, if you will, who brokers things and eases conversations. Do you know what I mean?
Makes the whole thing work, let’s be honest.
Yeah, absolutely. Like when Jackie goes to visit the Kennedys for the first time in Hyannisport, Lem is there to kind of decode their whole kingdom for her in a way that Jack kind of can’t be bothered to do. I actually think in real life, that’s a dynamic that exists more often than we think. And it’s fun — or more often than we read about in novels. I found it really fun to look at this angle on history through the eyes of a friend.
And Lem and Jackie both have a lot to lose in this relationship, and we come to understand that over the course of the novel. So it’s this balance between nostalgia and kind of poignancy and also great fashion and great food and great cocktails. And to me, it hit the perfect summer book club note.
You’ve mentioned fun a couple of times, so I assume that in terms of the style and the overall feeling of the book, that it includes both intimate emotional tones and humor. It sounds like they are — kind of hits all the notes and has a wide palette.
Absolutely, and it begins with Lem in 1981 seeing Jackie walking down a street in New York City. They don’t say hi. You realize that they were friends at some point. You don’t know why they’ve become estranged. So he’s looking back with the perspective of time.
Actually, there’s a great epigraph at the front I just wanted to read that kind of sets the tone for the whole book. It’s from “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” by Oscar Wilde. And it just says, “Young men want to be faithful and are not. Old men want to be faithless and cannot. This is all one can say.” And that sense of mystery and promise sets up the tone of the book for me.
Well, we should emphasize, before we start talking about a related book, that we talked before we came on air about how you are not a Kennedy obsessive. And so you are not recommending this book simply because anything between two covers about the Kennedys would appeal to you.
I should say, I mean, you might guess from my name, Liz Egan, I am of Irish-American stock. My grandmother definitely had a picture hanging in her kitchen alongside the Pope’s picture. So I mean, I grew up with a certain curiosity about the Kennedys, but I don’t totally understand some people’s complete obsession with them. I also feel like this poor family at a certain point should just be left alone. But this book didn’t feel to me like it crossed any ethical boundaries, and it just drew me in.
The other book that I wanted to mention is another book that doesn’t name the Kennedys, but is inspired by a Kennedys story. It’s called “Meant to Be.” And it’s by Emily Giffin. It came out on May 31st. And it reimagines the story of J.F.K. Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who was his wife. They died together in a plane crash in the summer of 1999.
And Emily Giffin writes this really frothy and fun, but also incredibly tragic, in some ways, story of this couple. The man in the story is Joseph S. Kingsley Jr., who comes from a political dynasty and marries a young model named Cate Cooper. And Emily Giffin kind of asks the question of, what would have happened if some of the circumstances in J.F.K. Jr.‘s story had been tweaked slightly? I don’t want to give too much away, but it’s clearly inspired by the Kennedy story and is equally gripping and a really fun companion to read with “Jackie & Me.”
Well, so there it is, some extra homework for the book clubs. It could be a twofer if they would like it to be.
Yes.
Very good of you, Liz, keeping people busy for the summer months.
I like to perform that service.
So this month’s Group Text pick, again, is “Jackie & Me,” by Louis Bayard. Liz, thanks for being here to talk about it.
Thanks, John. [MUSIC PLAYING]
Matthew Schneier is here. He is a features writer at New York Magazine and The Cut, and a former colleague of mine here at The Times. He recently reviewed for us a new biography, “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym,” by Paula Byrne. And he’s here to talk about both that and Pym’s work. Hi, Matt.
Hi.
Great to have you here. So this is a big biography. Let’s start by telling people— Pym is one of those writers who comes in and out of fashion, as you note in your review. So just give us a thumbnail sketch of who she was, when she wrote and what her books were like.
Barbara Pym was an English novelist whose life spanned much of the 20th century. She began writing really young. Her first novel she ever worked on, I think, was at 16. And after she went up to Oxford, she began writing in earnest. And the first novel of hers that was ever published a number of years later was begun there and based on kind of the friends that she made there. She had a real run of modest polite success between 1950 and, I think, 1961. She published six novels in pretty quick succession.
And they’re great, if people haven’t read them. And I know many people haven’t, even though among the sort of devoted Pym heads, she’s a real passion. They’re these little sweet character sketches, very clever, very witty. She was often compared to Jane Austen, which was a writer that she loved and appreciated, but also a kind of very easy comparison, whereas Pym, I think, is a little bit — her ironies can be a little bit darker than some of Austen’s.
And there’s a sense in her work that she is spotlighting characters who are not the kind of Emma Woodhouses who are beautiful and rich and effervescent. They’re what she sort of ended up calling “excellent women,” which is the title of, I think, her best sort of starter novel, these women who are well brought up and very proper, a little bit pious, but can also be a little dowdy, a little dreary, a little bit easier to overlook.
I mean, I think one thing that’s great about Pym is that she yanks the spotlight away from these more explosive, more effervescent characters that other novelists might focus on and focuses on these excellent women who are often seen at the periphery, kind of observing, often judging, but having an incredible insight and perspective of their own.
So it’s 2022. Why this biography now, and what does Paula Byrne bring to the table?
So, as you say, Pym has little vogues every couple of years. People are always rediscovering her work and then somehow always seeming to forget it a bit. This happened in her own lifetime. In the early ‘60s, she was still writing, and her publisher quite callously dropped her. They just felt that the swinging ‘60s were on the rise. And these were years where “Doctor No” was the best seller, the James Bond book, or at least, the best seller for her publishers at Jonathan Cape. And there was just the feeling that there wasn’t an interest in the kind of work that she was doing.
And really, she spent 15 or so years basically in the literary wilderness after that, still writing, writing entire novels, but basically for herself and her friends, until fortunes and tastes changed again and she was ushered back into the spotlight. And so that’s happened to her a number of times in her career. Never quite so much in the wilderness, but people discover her and their appreciations of her. And then she subsides into the ranks of minor novelists.
We should note that poor Ms. Pym has been dead for 42 years now, but this keeps happening to her reputation.
She has gone to her ultimate subsidement, sad to say. But yes, her reputation, I would say, has only grown in the years since her death. And one of her closest friends and colleagues, a woman named Hazel Holt, along with Pym’s beloved younger sister, Hilary, have taken up the mantle of Pym studies and published, after her death, a collection of her letters and diaries, which functioned as a kind of biography, or they called it an autobiography, even though Pym herself did not oversee it. Hazel Holt then wrote a biography a few years later than that herself.
But I think what Paula Byrne brings to the table is the distance of someone who was not a close intimate of hers, who was maybe less interested in sanding off some of her rough edges, and who was really willing to do the significant work of a serious, meaty, lengthy, as you say, biography. And as far as I know, it’s the first to do this full of a treatment using the huge store of Pymiana at the Bodleian Library at Oxford, where she donated her papers.
Pym heads, Pym-iana, we’re getting a whole vocabulary today. So the book clocks in at over 700 pages. But it is divided up, I noticed, and as you note in your review, into these incredibly short chapters. The table of contents runs for nine pages, which is almost unheard of these days, although I looked back and you make the point that Henry Fielding and his classic novel “Tom Jones” was perhaps an influence on Pym. And that novel has a 25-page table of contents. So I guess Byrne was maybe mimicking that. So she tells this story in little bursts. Does it feel coherent?
It does. This style of the kind of 18th century flourishes is not one that I thought was particularly necessary to the book, although to give Byrne credit, I think she’s styling it after one of Barbara Pym’s own diaries or journals, which she titled herself “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym,” whatever, in this very self-conscious, young, belletrist way to Fielding’s 18th-century novels she was reading.
But in terms of the short chapters, yes, I think the book skips along at a nice clip. It’s very engaging. Byrne herself is a very sprightly writer. And though it certainly takes detours into every kind of nook and cranny of Pym’s long life, I don’t think it feels like a slog. It does feel comprehensive to the occasional point of exhaustion.
It doesn’t sound from the review like it’s a biography that’s particularly heavy on literary analysis. How does she approach the work? What do you get out of that part of the book?
I was a little surprised by that, to be honest, although the work of the biographer and the work of the literary critic are not, strictly speaking, the same. She certainly treats all of Pym’s novels individually, the six she published in her early burst, then some later ones once she began being published again, some juvenilia, some unpublished things. Because Pym donated all of her manuscripts to Oxford, she has access to early drafts. And in some cases, those drafts had surprising things that didn’t make it into the final work.
I think her analyses don’t go that much farther than plot summary. That’s OK. She has her tastes among the books. She allows in some of her personal judgment. But I, for one, having read and loved, I should say, all of Pym’s novels, was hungry for a little bit more about the correspondences between them, the evolution between them, especially because — and this is something that Pym’s readers have always noted — they sort of all function as a kind of Pym extended universe, in the same way as sort of Marvel extended universe, where characters recur and plot points are picked up later in completely different books.
You really get the sense that Pym is sketching the broad contours of a world. They are not a series, and they’re not all about the same characters. But it’s a nice little parlor game of finding favorite minor characters popping up in this book or that, or stories being embroidered upon from a novel or two ago in the next one.
You hinted at some surprises that were in the drafts of novels that didn’t make them into the final books. What were some of those? And how self-conscious was Pym about taking those things out? And why didn’t they make it in?
Well, the real one, the sort of blockbuster of this book, although I should note that the devoted readers, researchers of the Barbara Pym Society, which is a wonderful collective of true obsessives that I’ve spent a very little bit of time with, this is not news to them. However, I think it will be news to many of Pym’s more casual readers that she had a kind of flirtation with Nazism in the ‘30s. She learned German while she was at Oxford.
She was an ardent Germanophile. Byrne is very good about the ways in which she styled herself in the German mode. She wore a Tyrolean hat. She would pepper her speech with German phrases, pretty relevantly. And she ended up visiting Germany several times in the 1930s as Nazism was on the rise and, in fact, fell in love with a member of the SS. We think most likely the SS. There’s some debate about that. But I tend to agree with Byrne that it seems most likely that he was in the SS, a Hitler guard.
And in the novel that eventually was published as “Some Tame Gazelle,” which was her first published novel— but she was working on all the way back to the Oxford days— it is based, in part, on her and her sister and her friends. And the main character, who was originally called Barbara — in the published version is called Belinda — has an ongoing flirtation with a Nazi and with Nazism.
And in the 1930s, I think it was perhaps difficult to see clearly what was to come. In retrospect, this seems abhorrent to us, and obviously it is. But to give Pym some credit, I think it was hard to foresee exactly where it would go. And later in her life, she did seem to recant all of her interest in this.
That said, even at the time, savvy friends were reading. Her friend Jack Liddell, who became a novelist in his own right and critic, and her sister Hilary, who was vehemently anti-Nazi, were encouraging her to remove all of the Nazi references from the book. And by the time it was published, she had in there funny substitutions. Like, a swastika brooch becomes in the published version a little seed pearl brooch.
Quite a substitution.
Yeah, so this is not quite a gotcha moment, but it certainly gives a kind of different context and flavor to Pym’s life and to Pym’s work. And this is the sort of thing that’s really sort of soft pedaled, if included at all, in the earlier autobiography and biography. This is something that Hazel Holt and Hilary Pym didn’t really want to touch, I gather.
She’s an author who is beloved among her fans and readers, so it’s hard to square that. So they look the other way sometimes.
There is a photo that’s reproduced in the book of Pym sunbathing beneath a swastika flag in Germany. And obviously, that’s something that is difficult to see and unpleasant to see. But I think Byrne does make a fairly good case that she really recanted all of these positions and that the positions weren’t — there doesn’t seem to be a lot of evidence that these positions were based on her own anti-Semitism or anything of that sort. It was really more a flirtation, it seems, both with the culture and then with this one specific officer in particular.
Right, and maybe her interest in the country got away with her. So you write in your review that she had a tough-luck love life. How did her personal life influence her fiction, or did it? And what was her domestic life like?
This poor woman, she loved to love, and she had a fairly hard go of it. One of the things that’s really interesting about the biography is that Byrne is able to make a pretty good case that Pym was not a liberated woman in the kind of post-1960s, post-1970s sense. However, because her reputation settled into this sort of slightly dusty, slightly churchy mode of these kind of excellent women, I think a lot of readers maybe expect that she’s a bit virginal. She herself quite openly calls herself a spinster.
So I think it’s not a huge leap to imagine that she was sort of not interested in any of that. And in fact, she had quite an active love and sex life beginning at Oxford and continuing throughout her life. She had dalliances with friends and with lovers. She tended to have bad luck. She tended to fall for people who were unavailable in some way, in some cases married, in some cases not interested or not durably interested.
And she’d tend to hold on pretty tight. She had one affair with a guy who later became an MP, Julian Amery. And I think in total, they spent 20 hours together. And she wrote in one of her journals, I think, “it was 20 hours, but it will sustain me for 20 years.” And she ended up subsisting on crumbs a bit.
But that said, she used a lot of these feelings and a lot of these characters in her work and transmogrified them into her fiction, in some cases getting a little bit of revenge. She could send up the pomposity of the tiresomeness of some of the men who were giving her things like respect and esteem, where she might have preferred love and adoration, in work.
You mentioned that her reputation got churchy and dusty, but I assume, given your joy in the books, that there is a great deal of humor in them. What are the delights in them?
She’s a really witty, lovely, understated writer. She has a kind of sense of — I don’t know if it’s exactly a sense of the absurd, but she certainly is willing to poke and prick at the social rigors and proprieties and morés of her own class, of churchgoers. I think she is magnanimous without being pious. She was a devoted churchgoer all her life. She was a believing Anglican. It’s a major focus of her novels. But she is not as uptight about it as that description might suggest.
And so I have to say, I did not know very much about high services and vicars and abbots and whatever else and all the rest when I began reading her book several years ago. And it did not, in any way, hamper my enjoyment of them.
Well, you mentioned briefly “Excellent Women,” which I think is both — it is considered probably her best, but also it’s her most famous at this point. I’m curious as to whether the other books blend into each other a bit tone-wise, or whether there’s one other than “Excellent Women” that rises above to you and becomes better than the rest.
Her books certainly all are a kind of self-contained canon, but I do think just about every individual one that I’ve read is a worthy and wonderful small novel. I shouldn’t keep calling them small. That sounds condescending and reductive. They’re actually a kind of perfect, gem-like novel. And I appreciate them much more for that. I mean, if my constant complaints about Paula Byrne and her 700-page biography suggest anything, it’s that maybe my sweet spot is 200 to 300 pages.
My favorite among them after “Excellent Women” is one called “A Glass of Blessings.” It’s a little bit later on. It features, unusually, a central protagonist who’s married and who’s dealing with the ups and downs of a long and perhaps slightly stale marriage. It also, in an interesting way, brings in the perspective of gay characters. Pym was very friendly with, and sometimes a bit in love with, gay men throughout her life. They were some of her most devoted readers. They were some of her best friends.
And very unusually, for the time, they ended up featuring quite prominently in some of her novels. So there’s a very interesting interplay. In “A Glass of Blessings,” between this married woman, Wilmet Forsyth, a very Pym name, who has a kind of flirtation and a dalliance with — or thinks she does — with a man who turns out to be gay and in a gay relationship. That one’s wonderful. That was a favorite of some of Pym’s readers. I believe it was Philip Larkin’s favorite.
It’s not Paula Byrne’s favorite. Paula Byrne makes special notice of a late Pym novel called “The Sweet Dove Died,” and contends that it’s her best novel. And I actually would have loved to hear a little bit more about why, because I vehemently disagree. But interested parties might go looking for that one, too. It’s a slightly darker novel. And it’s certainly worth a read. It just, to me, doesn’t rise to the level of those other two I mentioned.
I should mention that five years ago, you wrote for The Times a piece in praise of Barbara Pym, in which you parsed some other novels of hers and recommended a few others. So readers should go and find that. You wrote that “Lately, she has found new favor, though it is still more common to find readers who mean to read Pym than those who have actually read her, but you should.”
So we’re sending you off to read Barbara Pym and the new biography of her by Paula Byrne, “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym,” and the work of Matt Schneier, a features writer at New York Magazine and The Cut. Seek out his work as well as Pym’s. Matt, thanks for being here to talk about it.
Thanks for letting me soapbox even more about Pym. I’m still going, five years later.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Alexandra Alter is here with notes from the literary world. Hi, Alexandra.
Hi, John.
You talked to a real character recently. Werner Herzog, the filmmaker, has done something new at his advanced age.
Yes, so Werner Herzog has just released, this week, a new novel, his first. It’s his debut. And he’s almost 80 years old. And of course, he’s known for his filmmaking. He’s made more than 70 films by his count. And so it was a surprising late-career turn. And I wanted to talk to him about why he made this shift.
He has written some notable nonfiction books before.
That’s right. He has been writing throughout his career. And he’s written a lot of poetry. I don’t think he’s published much of it. But he’s written some books of essays, books of journals. One of his more well-known books, “Of Walking in Ice,” describes this journey he made on foot from Munich to Paris. It was 600 miles in the dead of winter. He went to visit a dying friend, and he wrote about it.
Another one that I think is quite well known is his account of all the disasters that occurred while he was making his film “Fitzcarraldo” in the Peruvian jungle. There were many, including a crew member who had to amputate his own foot with a chainsaw after a venomous snake bite — plane crashes, fires. He’s definitely a writer as well as a filmmaker.
What was surprising to me, though, is the extent to which he identifies himself that way creatively. He told me he believes he’ll be remembered more for his prose than his films. And so this story that he tells in his first novel, “The Twilight World,” is one that he has been ruminating on for more than 25 years and thought about making a film about, but ultimately decided it would work better in a novel form.
So the story that he tells is actually a true one. It’s about Hiroo Onoda, who was an intelligence officer in the army in Japan during World War II and was deployed to this island in the Philippines and was told to secure the territory and make sure the enemy didn’t make any inroads there, and was also warned that he might not get any more orders once the troops had withdrawn. He was simply to stay there and make sure that that territory was held.
And so he followed those orders for an extraordinary amount of time. He was there in the jungle for nearly 30 years. He refused to believe that Japan had surrendered, that the war was over. When leaflets were dropped announcing the end of the war, he saw spelling errors and assumed they were enemy forgeries.
So it’s really a very Werner Herzogian character. Herzog loves these extreme figures, like Timothy Treadwell, the man who embedded himself with grizzly bears to his own detriment. He was mauled to death. Or he loves stories about people who go to the edge of a volcano that’s about to erupt, anyone who is testing themselves against nature. And so Onoda was very much one of these figures.
And what was, I think, even more compelling for Herzog was that he had met him when he was in Japan in the ‘90s to direct an opera. He was asked if he wanted to meet the emperor. And he said no, which caused a great amount of shock amongst his colleagues. It was like an incredible faux pas. And then they said, “Well then, who else do you want to meet? And he said Onoda, and they met. And so he told me that he based this novel largely on those conversations that they had, as well as Onoda’s own autobiography.
Did he tell you why he didn’t either make this a film or write it as a nonfiction book since he knew him personally?
I did ask him that. And he’s not quite comfortable with the fiction label. He said “I understand why they categorized it this way, but I’m not sure if it is a novel.” It’s very much written like a novel, because apart from the first-person account of meeting Onoda, which occurs at the beginning and the end, the bulk of the narrative is from a close third-person account of what Onoda experienced in the jungle. So it doesn’t quite have that heft of nonfiction.
But when I asked “Why did you write this as a novel?” he gave me the most Werner Herzogian answer that you can imagine. He basically said the way that time operated for Onoda, you couldn’t capture in film. This is what — I’ll give you the direct quote. He said, “We settle ourselves into a grand fiction of present time. It is a fiction. Technically, present time does not exist. Our sense of present time is technically impossible, because when you lift a foot from the ground, lifting it up has already passed. Setting it down on the ground is already future.”
So he felt like this was something that he couldn’t capture in film. He needed to explore the strange mental space that Onoda was experiencing, as well as the way time can speed up or slow down in the jungle. Herzog has spent a lot of time in the jungle himself. So he decided a novel was the way to do it. I think there was also a practical reason, which was that he wrote this book at the start of the pandemic, when his film production was shut down, and his wife Elena told him, basically, “You need to do something.” He’s a hyper-productive person, so he wrote this novel. And then right after, he wrote his autobiography, which is 300 pages and is being translated from German as we speak.
Oh, wow, so we’ll get that soon-ish.
It should be soon-ish, yes, and it has a fantastic title, which comes from one of his films. It’s “Every Man for Himself, and God Against All.”
[LAUGHS]: So, OK, given that title and the quote you read— I assume that many of our listeners are familiar with Herzog. And I don’t know whether “persona” is the right word, because it seems to just be him. It’s not something he puts on. He’s a very interesting guy with a very interesting way of seeing the world and speaking about it. What was it like to meet him? I assume you did this over video?
We did it over video because he was in Austria in the mountains where he had just finished recording the audiobook of “The Twilight World” and of his memoir. He did a German version of the memoir and then the English version of the audiobook. He was a fascinating person to talk to, and also a challenging interview subject because — this has come up in other interviews he’s done, of course. He’s given many over the years—
but he says — and it’s true from my experience — he’s very averse to self-reflection and introspection.
So if you try to probe why he’s interested in certain subjects or the way that he works or what inspires him, he really has very little patience for those questions. He really wants to talk about either these figures that he has lionized in his work, either in his films or now in his novel, or what they represent. So a lot of his reflections on those characters are very philosophical. He will not waste any time on small talk or talking about himself.
So there isn’t any small talk, which isn’t surprising to me, but is there any sense of warmth? Or is it just like talking to an intimidating oracle?
No, he was quite good-humored. And it’s exactly like you say. It’s not a persona that he puts on. This is simply who he is. And it’s very much like the voice that you hear narrating his documentary. The voice in his prose is very similar to that. I haven’t read his poetry, but I have to imagine it’s along those lines, too. So, yeah, it is kind of like engaging with the Werner Herzog that we’ve seen over the years.
That’s amazing. I really wish I could have been a fly on the Zoom while this was happening. But as always, people can go online and read the full piece of your interview with Herzog and your take on the book, which is really great in and of itself. Alexandra, thanks for being here.
Thanks so much for having me.

Two of The Times’s book critics are here, half of our fearsome foursome, Jennifer Szalai and Molly Young. Hello, you two.
Hi, John.
Hey, John.
So we’re going to get into the books you’ve most recently reviewed. Jen, you reviewed something that was fascinating, if a little gruesome. Is that a fair word?
Yeah, I guess gruesome is a fair word, although, I should say— so the book that I reviewed is called “The Facemaker.” And it basically tells the story, the life, of the reconstructive surgeon Harold Gillies, who, during World War I, mended the faces of those men who were sent to war and came back to England, which is where he was based.
Lindsey Fitzharris, who’s the author, she wrote a previous book called “The Butchering Art,” which was about Victorian medicine and how there was this deepening understanding of the role of germs, essentially, and how that made a huge difference. And so this book, I feel like, is an appropriate sequel to that. Gillies was working at a time where there was a better understanding of how germs actually worked, but this was before antibiotics.
So he was treating men who were subject to this new technology during World War I. It was a new kind of warfare. And so these were men who, because there was a better understanding of antiseptics, they might survive injuries that, in the past, would have been completely fatal. And so he was dealing with really severe facial injuries. Some of these men couldn’t necessarily eat because they had jaws that no longer existed. Some of them weren’t able to close their eyes to sleep because something had happened to their eyelids.
So she tells the story of how he basically improvised a new approach to surgery. And he wasn’t alone. She does talk about other doctors, other specialists, like dentists, who really pushed this field forward. And it’s completely fascinating. I mean, she’s a really good storyteller. She apparently even has her own television show, called “The Curious Life and Death Of” on the Smithsonian Channel, which I haven’t seen. But she’s clearly interested in matters of life, death, medicine, all that kind of stuff.
And at pivotal moments in that history. You said that she mentions the other people who helped him out. And obviously, there are many pioneers in this field. But why do you think she centers the book on Gillies? Because of his pioneering work or his personality or both?
I think it’s a combination of things. I think first of all, he was really collaborative. And I think that she wants to emphasize that even though there were other surgeons who were working to repair facial disfigurements during the war, he was somebody who really felt it was necessary to collaborate with others and to see facial surgery as interdisciplinary. And so I think she thinks that that’s very important.
Also, I think as a doctor with a particular bedside manner, I mean, he really understood that facial injuries were different from other kinds of wartime injuries. Amputees during World War I were often held up as heroes, whereas people whose faces were essentially totally unrecognizable were often treated as reminders, like actual graphic reminders, of the carnage during the war. So they were often avoided, shunned. And so he really took it upon himself not just to treat the physical injuries, but to give them the kind of psychological encouragement that a lot of these men— she consults some of their papers— it was very, very meaningful to them.
Is it a story, the way she tells it, that feels sort of mostly like a narrative science history? Or is that human element really stressed throughout? I mean, I imagine there’s something very moving about his relationships with some of these men, and certainly, what they’re going through.
She is very interested in the human element. And it is very moving, especially when she covers the experience of some of the men who found themselves in his care. And so she recreates what actually happened to them and how they found themselves being treated by him. But at the same time, he sort of comes across — and this might be what he was actually like as a person— but he definitely comes across as a hero. You don’t get a sense of interpersonal drama.
Really, the suspense of the narrative takes place in terms of, is he going to be able to help this person? And she recreates some of his experiences in the operating theater in such a way that really gives you a sense that what he was doing was new. And he really had to figure out a lot of these things on the fly. And it was really important to him to prepare. I think he recognized that in order to improvise, he had to have certain structures in place. But then once he got into the operating room, he really just had to pay very close attention to what was going on and to the specifics of each patient’s experience.
Yeah, well, and some of the things he pioneered are really incredible, reading about them in your review. I’ll close by asking on a scale of one to 10, squeamishly, how high up do you have to be before this becomes a tough read?
It’s pretty intense, I would say. Fitzharris, I give her credit because you could be really voyeuristic with this book, and she’s not really interested in that, although I think it’s really important for her, as well as for the narrative, to be specific and to evoke exactly what was going on, especially what made these facial wounds so difficult to treat. So she really does have to get into that stuff. I would say one to 10, maybe a six or seven.
But I should also say that there are a series of photographs in the book, which readers can skip because they’re all collected in the middle, where you actually get some of the photographs of the patients that were taken at the time. And the transformation that Gillies was able to make on some of these patients is really astonishing. But at the same time, you look at what they started out with. And I can imagine that it was really difficult for a lot of these patients to handle.
Hmm. Molly, you reviewed a book that is also about a fascinating subject, obviously one that is less life or death oriented, but one that especially I think people who grew up — and the three of us, our general age group, looping Jen and I into your younger cohort— we all grew up with this structure very much in our lives. What book did you write about this week?
I wrote about a book called “Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall,” by the design critic Alexandra Lange.
And this is a, as the subtitle says, an inside history. So what is the purpose here, to draw us from the earliest malls to the current day? And is there a larger argument behind the book, pro-mall or anti-mall?
She does end up making a pro-mall argument, but it’s a qualified argument. So the book begins with kind of an overview of what the mall was and how it came to be. And then it moves on to discuss how this architectural innovation evolved, or devolved, and how it shaped the way people behaved inside spaces.
And I was talking about the book with somebody, and I mentioned the sort of timeline, which is that malls, as we think of them, are a post-World War II invention. And my friend was like, “Oh, that’s so weird. I thought malls had been around for much longer than that.” And then I was talking with someone else. And they were like, “Oh, that’s weird. I thought malls were invented in the ‘80s.”
That’s what I would have said.
There were department stores in the 1800s, and those were kind of a pre-mall idea where you had big stores that had all sorts of various items in them. And the idea was that people could spend a long time browsing and not leaving the store. But what we think of as the shopping mall or complex, it’s a very specific thing. It’s a collection of stores that are connected by recreational spaces, like food courts and greenery and playgrounds. It has tons of parking.
There are certain shapes that malls tend to have. There’s the classic dumbbell shape, which is where you have an anchor tenant at either side. There’s U-shaped malls and O-shaped malls. And I think there’s one Z-shaped mall, which is an anomaly.
Terrifying.
Terrifying.
I certainly think of malls as something that had their big boom time in the ‘80s, maybe into the ‘90s. But what were the post-World War II, what were the big innovations? And when did they happen? Where were they?
So they happened in the Midwest. All roads lead back to this one guy named Victor Gruen, who fled Vienna in the late 1930s and arrived in New York. And he’d studied architecture, so he started working in retail. And the interesting thing about Gruen is that politically and culturally, he was very much a socialist. And so it’s funny that this is a guy that basically invents the great American temple of consumerism.
But on the other hand, Lange points out that this is also a guy who’s a fan of very large, top-down planning efforts. And if you look at his earliest proposals for malls, these were spaces that weren’t just shops, but they also had post offices and schools and community centers and dentists. And so, in his conception, there is always a civic dimension to the mall that, obviously, later went away because it wasn’t contributing to the cash spent per square foot.
He wasn’t just interested in pretzels and CDs is what you’re saying?
Amazingly, no, no.
Through the book, you introduced me to this concept called the Gruen transfer, which puts a very specific term to something that I felt in my soul many times. What is that?
Oh, yes, the Gruen transfer. This is something that he probably would not want attached to his name. But it’s a description of what happens basically when you enter a shopping center with a goal in mind. Like, I want to buy a stereo. And then by exposure to other things, you end up buying something else and something else and something else, maybe a Mrs. Fields cookie and then maybe a pair of earrings on your way back out. And it’s the idea of shopping transforming from a task to a form of recreation, and how all the sort of temptations of the mall are designed to make that transfer happen.
You said that it is pro-mall, but with qualifications. I would say that the anti-mall case, at least the way I’ve heard it from people over the years, could be summed up as, it’s a bit soulless. That Gruen transfer, I guess, the negative side of that is that you end up just spending your money on some useless things. But what are the arguments that Lange makes for revivifying malls? Because a lot of them have been abandoned and are defunct now. But she wants to, I assume, bring them back with some qualifications.
Exactly, and she mentions this whole genre of dead mall, zombie mall photography and exploration, which, if you go on YouTube or Reddit, there’s a thriving community of people who take photos of decaying malls. And it’s true that, I mean, they are very difficult to repurpose. It’s not easy to turn a mall into housing or a school because it’s such a specific structure.
But she points out something really interesting, which is also something that Joan Didion pointed out in her essay about malls. And the idea is that these commercial imperatives around malls accidentally created a form of space that accommodated people who don’t otherwise have a lot of societal power. So the young, the old, the disabled, the poor. A mall has to be compliant, so there have to be ramps and easily accessible elevators and signage.
And it’s also climate controlled, so if you live somewhere where there are extremes of weather, you can go into a mall for free, in theory, and escape that. There’s bathrooms, some form of security. Sometimes it’s a good thing. Sometimes it’s a bad thing. But at one point, teenagers could go to a mall and their parents would allow them to do that, because there would be mall cops. And so there is the assurance that nobody would get into too much trouble. Of course, the other side of that is that mall cops can be forces of harassment and irritation, especially for skateboarders.
You sound like you speak from experience there, but we won’t get into that.
Yeah, so the idea is that in theory, a mall could be a very welcoming place. And it could perform a service. But in reality, there are a lot of reasons why that tends not to be the case.
I did find myself while I was reading your review, you were sort of enunciating some of these things about what a mall can be. And it was as if the concept hadn’t existed before. And I thought, wow, this really does sound like a great idea. So maybe there is a way to bring it back and just keep the great stuff and ameliorate some of the bad stuff somehow. Let’s go over again the books you reviewed most recently.
I reviewed “The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I,” by Lindsey Fitzharris.
I reviewed “Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall,” by Alexandra Lange. [MUSIC PLAYING]

You come to understand what Jackie has at stake and has to lose by committing to this life with the Kennedys.
Liz Egan, an editor at the Book Review, is here to talk about Louis Bayard’s new novel, “Jackie & Me,” which imagines the life of the young Jacqueline Bouvier before she became Jackie Kennedy.
What Paula Byrne brings to the table is the distance of someone who was not a close intimate of hers, who was maybe less interested in sanding off some of her rough edges.
Matthew Schneier is here to talk about a new biography of the British novelist Barbara Pym. Plus, Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world. And Times critics Jennifer Szalai and Molly Young join me to talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. This is the Book Review Podcast. It’s June 17. I’m John Williams.
[MUSIC STOPS] Liz Egan joins me now. She’s an editor at the Book Review and also the curator of the Book Review’s Group Text column. Hi, Liz.
Hi, John. How are you?
I’m good. So you’re here to talk about your latest pick for Group Text, the June pick. And we should just say briefly up front for those who aren’t aware — you haven’t been on in a while — that the Group Text series is a book each month that you pick that you think is particularly well suited to book club discussion. Is that fair?
That is fair. And I usually include — I always include, along with my review, suggestions for further reading, and then a couple of questions to maybe kickstart your conversation with your book group about that particular book.
Right, so this is a real starter pack. There’s no excuse for people not to choose this for their book club by the time you’re done giving them the outline.
Definitely not. And in the case of my June pick, not only is it a really discussion-worthy book, but it’s also really fun. And I imagine a book group sitting outside with frosty glasses of rosé and having not just a deep conversation, but also a fun one.
You’ve picked a novel by a veteran novelist, Louis Bayard. This is his 10th book. Tell us about it.
This book is called “Jackie & Me.” And it is the story of the friendship between a real-life friend of J.F.K.‘s whose name was Lem Billings. He was a friend of John Kennedy’s from high school, and remained his friend, I believe, until his death. And Louis Bayard imagines the friendship that sprung up between Lem and Jackie before she married Jack.
So the book begins in the summer of 1951, when the two meet one another. And they become really fast friends, as J.F.K. is kind of becoming J.F.K. and running for office and laying the groundwork for his major political career. And he turns to Lem as sort of his fixer and his trusted adviser, and basically asks Lem to entertain Jackie.
This is rooted in reality, but Bayard runs with it and imagines conversations between Lem and Jackie and just shows this, on one hand, fabulous life of parties and museums and fun they had together, but also sets up this ticking clock where you come to understand what Jackie really has at stake and has to lose by committing to this life with the Kennedys. And that includes a career of her own and a private life, which she values deeply, and also fidelity. We come to understand that this relationship with Jack will involve some extracurricular activity on his part. And Lem becomes close to her and cares about her. And you see him feel very torn about how much to warn her about what she’s in store for.
You mentioned that the story is rooted in history. And I’m not sure if Bayard gives a sense of this anywhere in the book before or after he starts the proper story, but do you know how deeply rooted, and how close the relationship was, and also whether Lem actually functioned in life as this buffer figure?
He definitely did function in real life as a buffer figure. In fact, there’s another whole book written about the relationship between Jack and Lem. And in an author’s note, Bayard states — actually, it appears at the back of the book, which I thought was an interesting decision on his part. He does say this is entirely a work of fiction. But this person, Lem Billings, really did exist. And there’s been a fair amount written about him. But he’s obviously imagining — Bayard is imagining everything else and filling in the gaps.
I had never heard of Lem Billings before. His full name is Kirk LeMoyne Billings. He was gay at a time when, in the circle he ran in, it wasn’t really spoken about. And he was fiercely loyal to Jack. In my obsessive Googling of him, some have said he was in love with Jack. I’ll leave that to history. But he was really loyal to the Kennedy family, and very much a part of their gatherings, and served as this buffer between Jack and Jackie.
Bayard has written other books about presidential relationships, and has written other historical novels. What is your sense about— not the accuracy of this one per se— but just that feeling of how immersed do you feel in it, how much does it feel stage managed, the details, and how vivid is it?
I felt incredibly immersed in it, to the point where I kept forgetting that pieces of it were true. This really was a man running for Senate. This really was a young woman who had a kind of exciting career as a photographer and had ambitions of her own. He puts you right in that moment. And I should also say, even if you’re not somebody who particularly cares very much about the Kennedys, it’s a great story. I feel like in many relationships, there’s kind of a third wheel, if you will, who brokers things and eases conversations. Do you know what I mean?
Makes the whole thing work, let’s be honest.
Yeah, absolutely. Like when Jackie goes to visit the Kennedys for the first time in Hyannisport, Lem is there to kind of decode their whole kingdom for her in a way that Jack kind of can’t be bothered to do. I actually think in real life, that’s a dynamic that exists more often than we think. And it’s fun — or more often than we read about in novels. I found it really fun to look at this angle on history through the eyes of a friend.
And Lem and Jackie both have a lot to lose in this relationship, and we come to understand that over the course of the novel. So it’s this balance between nostalgia and kind of poignancy and also great fashion and great food and great cocktails. And to me, it hit the perfect summer book club note.
You’ve mentioned fun a couple of times, so I assume that in terms of the style and the overall feeling of the book, that it includes both intimate emotional tones and humor. It sounds like they are — kind of hits all the notes and has a wide palette.
Absolutely, and it begins with Lem in 1981 seeing Jackie walking down a street in New York City. They don’t say hi. You realize that they were friends at some point. You don’t know why they’ve become estranged. So he’s looking back with the perspective of time.
Actually, there’s a great epigraph at the front I just wanted to read that kind of sets the tone for the whole book. It’s from “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” by Oscar Wilde. And it just says, “Young men want to be faithful and are not. Old men want to be faithless and cannot. This is all one can say.” And that sense of mystery and promise sets up the tone of the book for me.
Well, we should emphasize, before we start talking about a related book, that we talked before we came on air about how you are not a Kennedy obsessive. And so you are not recommending this book simply because anything between two covers about the Kennedys would appeal to you.
I should say, I mean, you might guess from my name, Liz Egan, I am of Irish-American stock. My grandmother definitely had a picture hanging in her kitchen alongside the Pope’s picture. So I mean, I grew up with a certain curiosity about the Kennedys, but I don’t totally understand some people’s complete obsession with them. I also feel like this poor family at a certain point should just be left alone. But this book didn’t feel to me like it crossed any ethical boundaries, and it just drew me in.
The other book that I wanted to mention is another book that doesn’t name the Kennedys, but is inspired by a Kennedys story. It’s called “Meant to Be.” And it’s by Emily Giffin. It came out on May 31st. And it reimagines the story of J.F.K. Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who was his wife. They died together in a plane crash in the summer of 1999.
And Emily Giffin writes this really frothy and fun, but also incredibly tragic, in some ways, story of this couple. The man in the story is Joseph S. Kingsley Jr., who comes from a political dynasty and marries a young model named Cate Cooper. And Emily Giffin kind of asks the question of, what would have happened if some of the circumstances in J.F.K. Jr.‘s story had been tweaked slightly? I don’t want to give too much away, but it’s clearly inspired by the Kennedy story and is equally gripping and a really fun companion to read with “Jackie & Me.”
Well, so there it is, some extra homework for the book clubs. It could be a twofer if they would like it to be.
Yes.
Very good of you, Liz, keeping people busy for the summer months.
I like to perform that service.
So this month’s Group Text pick, again, is “Jackie & Me,” by Louis Bayard. Liz, thanks for being here to talk about it.
Thanks, John. [MUSIC PLAYING]
Matthew Schneier is here. He is a features writer at New York Magazine and The Cut, and a former colleague of mine here at The Times. He recently reviewed for us a new biography, “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym,” by Paula Byrne. And he’s here to talk about both that and Pym’s work. Hi, Matt.
Hi.
Great to have you here. So this is a big biography. Let’s start by telling people— Pym is one of those writers who comes in and out of fashion, as you note in your review. So just give us a thumbnail sketch of who she was, when she wrote and what her books were like.
Barbara Pym was an English novelist whose life spanned much of the 20th century. She began writing really young. Her first novel she ever worked on, I think, was at 16. And after she went up to Oxford, she began writing in earnest. And the first novel of hers that was ever published a number of years later was begun there and based on kind of the friends that she made there. She had a real run of modest polite success between 1950 and, I think, 1961. She published six novels in pretty quick succession.
And they’re great, if people haven’t read them. And I know many people haven’t, even though among the sort of devoted Pym heads, she’s a real passion. They’re these little sweet character sketches, very clever, very witty. She was often compared to Jane Austen, which was a writer that she loved and appreciated, but also a kind of very easy comparison, whereas Pym, I think, is a little bit — her ironies can be a little bit darker than some of Austen’s.
And there’s a sense in her work that she is spotlighting characters who are not the kind of Emma Woodhouses who are beautiful and rich and effervescent. They’re what she sort of ended up calling “excellent women,” which is the title of, I think, her best sort of starter novel, these women who are well brought up and very proper, a little bit pious, but can also be a little dowdy, a little dreary, a little bit easier to overlook.
I mean, I think one thing that’s great about Pym is that she yanks the spotlight away from these more explosive, more effervescent characters that other novelists might focus on and focuses on these excellent women who are often seen at the periphery, kind of observing, often judging, but having an incredible insight and perspective of their own.
So it’s 2022. Why this biography now, and what does Paula Byrne bring to the table?
So, as you say, Pym has little vogues every couple of years. People are always rediscovering her work and then somehow always seeming to forget it a bit. This happened in her own lifetime. In the early ‘60s, she was still writing, and her publisher quite callously dropped her. They just felt that the swinging ‘60s were on the rise. And these were years where “Doctor No” was the best seller, the James Bond book, or at least, the best seller for her publishers at Jonathan Cape. And there was just the feeling that there wasn’t an interest in the kind of work that she was doing.
And really, she spent 15 or so years basically in the literary wilderness after that, still writing, writing entire novels, but basically for herself and her friends, until fortunes and tastes changed again and she was ushered back into the spotlight. And so that’s happened to her a number of times in her career. Never quite so much in the wilderness, but people discover her and their appreciations of her. And then she subsides into the ranks of minor novelists.
We should note that poor Ms. Pym has been dead for 42 years now, but this keeps happening to her reputation.
She has gone to her ultimate subsidement, sad to say. But yes, her reputation, I would say, has only grown in the years since her death. And one of her closest friends and colleagues, a woman named Hazel Holt, along with Pym’s beloved younger sister, Hilary, have taken up the mantle of Pym studies and published, after her death, a collection of her letters and diaries, which functioned as a kind of biography, or they called it an autobiography, even though Pym herself did not oversee it. Hazel Holt then wrote a biography a few years later than that herself.
But I think what Paula Byrne brings to the table is the distance of someone who was not a close intimate of hers, who was maybe less interested in sanding off some of her rough edges, and who was really willing to do the significant work of a serious, meaty, lengthy, as you say, biography. And as far as I know, it’s the first to do this full of a treatment using the huge store of Pymiana at the Bodleian Library at Oxford, where she donated her papers.
Pym heads, Pym-iana, we’re getting a whole vocabulary today. So the book clocks in at over 700 pages. But it is divided up, I noticed, and as you note in your review, into these incredibly short chapters. The table of contents runs for nine pages, which is almost unheard of these days, although I looked back and you make the point that Henry Fielding and his classic novel “Tom Jones” was perhaps an influence on Pym. And that novel has a 25-page table of contents. So I guess Byrne was maybe mimicking that. So she tells this story in little bursts. Does it feel coherent?
It does. This style of the kind of 18th century flourishes is not one that I thought was particularly necessary to the book, although to give Byrne credit, I think she’s styling it after one of Barbara Pym’s own diaries or journals, which she titled herself “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym,” whatever, in this very self-conscious, young, belletrist way to Fielding’s 18th-century novels she was reading.
But in terms of the short chapters, yes, I think the book skips along at a nice clip. It’s very engaging. Byrne herself is a very sprightly writer. And though it certainly takes detours into every kind of nook and cranny of Pym’s long life, I don’t think it feels like a slog. It does feel comprehensive to the occasional point of exhaustion.
It doesn’t sound from the review like it’s a biography that’s particularly heavy on literary analysis. How does she approach the work? What do you get out of that part of the book?
I was a little surprised by that, to be honest, although the work of the biographer and the work of the literary critic are not, strictly speaking, the same. She certainly treats all of Pym’s novels individually, the six she published in her early burst, then some later ones once she began being published again, some juvenilia, some unpublished things. Because Pym donated all of her manuscripts to Oxford, she has access to early drafts. And in some cases, those drafts had surprising things that didn’t make it into the final work.
I think her analyses don’t go that much farther than plot summary. That’s OK. She has her tastes among the books. She allows in some of her personal judgment. But I, for one, having read and loved, I should say, all of Pym’s novels, was hungry for a little bit more about the correspondences between them, the evolution between them, especially because — and this is something that Pym’s readers have always noted — they sort of all function as a kind of Pym extended universe, in the same way as sort of Marvel extended universe, where characters recur and plot points are picked up later in completely different books.
You really get the sense that Pym is sketching the broad contours of a world. They are not a series, and they’re not all about the same characters. But it’s a nice little parlor game of finding favorite minor characters popping up in this book or that, or stories being embroidered upon from a novel or two ago in the next one.
You hinted at some surprises that were in the drafts of novels that didn’t make them into the final books. What were some of those? And how self-conscious was Pym about taking those things out? And why didn’t they make it in?
Well, the real one, the sort of blockbuster of this book, although I should note that the devoted readers, researchers of the Barbara Pym Society, which is a wonderful collective of true obsessives that I’ve spent a very little bit of time with, this is not news to them. However, I think it will be news to many of Pym’s more casual readers that she had a kind of flirtation with Nazism in the ‘30s. She learned German while she was at Oxford.
She was an ardent Germanophile. Byrne is very good about the ways in which she styled herself in the German mode. She wore a Tyrolean hat. She would pepper her speech with German phrases, pretty relevantly. And she ended up visiting Germany several times in the 1930s as Nazism was on the rise and, in fact, fell in love with a member of the SS. We think most likely the SS. There’s some debate about that. But I tend to agree with Byrne that it seems most likely that he was in the SS, a Hitler guard.
And in the novel that eventually was published as “Some Tame Gazelle,” which was her first published novel— but she was working on all the way back to the Oxford days— it is based, in part, on her and her sister and her friends. And the main character, who was originally called Barbara — in the published version is called Belinda — has an ongoing flirtation with a Nazi and with Nazism.
And in the 1930s, I think it was perhaps difficult to see clearly what was to come. In retrospect, this seems abhorrent to us, and obviously it is. But to give Pym some credit, I think it was hard to foresee exactly where it would go. And later in her life, she did seem to recant all of her interest in this.
That said, even at the time, savvy friends were reading. Her friend Jack Liddell, who became a novelist in his own right and critic, and her sister Hilary, who was vehemently anti-Nazi, were encouraging her to remove all of the Nazi references from the book. And by the time it was published, she had in there funny substitutions. Like, a swastika brooch becomes in the published version a little seed pearl brooch.
Quite a substitution.
Yeah, so this is not quite a gotcha moment, but it certainly gives a kind of different context and flavor to Pym’s life and to Pym’s work. And this is the sort of thing that’s really sort of soft pedaled, if included at all, in the earlier autobiography and biography. This is something that Hazel Holt and Hilary Pym didn’t really want to touch, I gather.
She’s an author who is beloved among her fans and readers, so it’s hard to square that. So they look the other way sometimes.
There is a photo that’s reproduced in the book of Pym sunbathing beneath a swastika flag in Germany. And obviously, that’s something that is difficult to see and unpleasant to see. But I think Byrne does make a fairly good case that she really recanted all of these positions and that the positions weren’t — there doesn’t seem to be a lot of evidence that these positions were based on her own anti-Semitism or anything of that sort. It was really more a flirtation, it seems, both with the culture and then with this one specific officer in particular.
Right, and maybe her interest in the country got away with her. So you write in your review that she had a tough-luck love life. How did her personal life influence her fiction, or did it? And what was her domestic life like?
This poor woman, she loved to love, and she had a fairly hard go of it. One of the things that’s really interesting about the biography is that Byrne is able to make a pretty good case that Pym was not a liberated woman in the kind of post-1960s, post-1970s sense. However, because her reputation settled into this sort of slightly dusty, slightly churchy mode of these kind of excellent women, I think a lot of readers maybe expect that she’s a bit virginal. She herself quite openly calls herself a spinster.
So I think it’s not a huge leap to imagine that she was sort of not interested in any of that. And in fact, she had quite an active love and sex life beginning at Oxford and continuing throughout her life. She had dalliances with friends and with lovers. She tended to have bad luck. She tended to fall for people who were unavailable in some way, in some cases married, in some cases not interested or not durably interested.
And she’d tend to hold on pretty tight. She had one affair with a guy who later became an MP, Julian Amery. And I think in total, they spent 20 hours together. And she wrote in one of her journals, I think, “it was 20 hours, but it will sustain me for 20 years.” And she ended up subsisting on crumbs a bit.
But that said, she used a lot of these feelings and a lot of these characters in her work and transmogrified them into her fiction, in some cases getting a little bit of revenge. She could send up the pomposity of the tiresomeness of some of the men who were giving her things like respect and esteem, where she might have preferred love and adoration, in work.
You mentioned that her reputation got churchy and dusty, but I assume, given your joy in the books, that there is a great deal of humor in them. What are the delights in them?
She’s a really witty, lovely, understated writer. She has a kind of sense of — I don’t know if it’s exactly a sense of the absurd, but she certainly is willing to poke and prick at the social rigors and proprieties and morés of her own class, of churchgoers. I think she is magnanimous without being pious. She was a devoted churchgoer all her life. She was a believing Anglican. It’s a major focus of her novels. But she is not as uptight about it as that description might suggest.
And so I have to say, I did not know very much about high services and vicars and abbots and whatever else and all the rest when I began reading her book several years ago. And it did not, in any way, hamper my enjoyment of them.
Well, you mentioned briefly “Excellent Women,” which I think is both — it is considered probably her best, but also it’s her most famous at this point. I’m curious as to whether the other books blend into each other a bit tone-wise, or whether there’s one other than “Excellent Women” that rises above to you and becomes better than the rest.
Her books certainly all are a kind of self-contained canon, but I do think just about every individual one that I’ve read is a worthy and wonderful small novel. I shouldn’t keep calling them small. That sounds condescending and reductive. They’re actually a kind of perfect, gem-like novel. And I appreciate them much more for that. I mean, if my constant complaints about Paula Byrne and her 700-page biography suggest anything, it’s that maybe my sweet spot is 200 to 300 pages.
My favorite among them after “Excellent Women” is one called “A Glass of Blessings.” It’s a little bit later on. It features, unusually, a central protagonist who’s married and who’s dealing with the ups and downs of a long and perhaps slightly stale marriage. It also, in an interesting way, brings in the perspective of gay characters. Pym was very friendly with, and sometimes a bit in love with, gay men throughout her life. They were some of her most devoted readers. They were some of her best friends.
And very unusually, for the time, they ended up featuring quite prominently in some of her novels. So there’s a very interesting interplay. In “A Glass of Blessings,” between this married woman, Wilmet Forsyth, a very Pym name, who has a kind of flirtation and a dalliance with — or thinks she does — with a man who turns out to be gay and in a gay relationship. That one’s wonderful. That was a favorite of some of Pym’s readers. I believe it was Philip Larkin’s favorite.
It’s not Paula Byrne’s favorite. Paula Byrne makes special notice of a late Pym novel called “The Sweet Dove Died,” and contends that it’s her best novel. And I actually would have loved to hear a little bit more about why, because I vehemently disagree. But interested parties might go looking for that one, too. It’s a slightly darker novel. And it’s certainly worth a read. It just, to me, doesn’t rise to the level of those other two I mentioned.
I should mention that five years ago, you wrote for The Times a piece in praise of Barbara Pym, in which you parsed some other novels of hers and recommended a few others. So readers should go and find that. You wrote that “Lately, she has found new favor, though it is still more common to find readers who mean to read Pym than those who have actually read her, but you should.”
So we’re sending you off to read Barbara Pym and the new biography of her by Paula Byrne, “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym,” and the work of Matt Schneier, a features writer at New York Magazine and The Cut. Seek out his work as well as Pym’s. Matt, thanks for being here to talk about it.
Thanks for letting me soapbox even more about Pym. I’m still going, five years later.

Alexandra Alter is here with notes from the literary world. Hi, Alexandra.
Hi, John.
You talked to a real character recently. Werner Herzog, the filmmaker, has done something new at his advanced age.
Yes, so Werner Herzog has just released, this week, a new novel, his first. It’s his debut. And he’s almost 80 years old. And of course, he’s known for his filmmaking. He’s made more than 70 films by his count. And so it was a surprising late-career turn. And I wanted to talk to him about why he made this shift.
He has written some notable nonfiction books before.
That’s right. He has been writing throughout his career. And he’s written a lot of poetry. I don’t think he’s published much of it. But he’s written some books of essays, books of journals. One of his more well-known books, “Of Walking in Ice,” describes this journey he made on foot from Munich to Paris. It was 600 miles in the dead of winter. He went to visit a dying friend, and he wrote about it.
Another one that I think is quite well known is his account of all the disasters that occurred while he was making his film “Fitzcarraldo” in the Peruvian jungle. There were many, including a crew member who had to amputate his own foot with a chainsaw after a venomous snake bite — plane crashes, fires. He’s definitely a writer as well as a filmmaker.
What was surprising to me, though, is the extent to which he identifies himself that way creatively. He told me he believes he’ll be remembered more for his prose than his films. And so this story that he tells in his first novel, “The Twilight World,” is one that he has been ruminating on for more than 25 years and thought about making a film about, but ultimately decided it would work better in a novel form.
So the story that he tells is actually a true one. It’s about Hiroo Onoda, who was an intelligence officer in the army in Japan during World War II and was deployed to this island in the Philippines and was told to secure the territory and make sure the enemy didn’t make any inroads there, and was also warned that he might not get any more orders once the troops had withdrawn. He was simply to stay there and make sure that that territory was held.
And so he followed those orders for an extraordinary amount of time. He was there in the jungle for nearly 30 years. He refused to believe that Japan had surrendered, that the war was over. When leaflets were dropped announcing the end of the war, he saw spelling errors and assumed they were enemy forgeries.
So it’s really a very Werner Herzogian character. Herzog loves these extreme figures, like Timothy Treadwell, the man who embedded himself with grizzly bears to his own detriment. He was mauled to death. Or he loves stories about people who go to the edge of a volcano that’s about to erupt, anyone who is testing themselves against nature. And so Onoda was very much one of these figures.
And what was, I think, even more compelling for Herzog was that he had met him when he was in Japan in the ‘90s to direct an opera. He was asked if he wanted to meet the emperor. And he said no, which caused a great amount of shock amongst his colleagues. It was like an incredible faux pas. And then they said, “Well then, who else do you want to meet? And he said Onoda, and they met. And so he told me that he based this novel largely on those conversations that they had, as well as Onoda’s own autobiography.
Did he tell you why he didn’t either make this a film or write it as a nonfiction book since he knew him personally?
I did ask him that. And he’s not quite comfortable with the fiction label. He said “I understand why they categorized it this way, but I’m not sure if it is a novel.” It’s very much written like a novel, because apart from the first-person account of meeting Onoda, which occurs at the beginning and the end, the bulk of the narrative is from a close third-person account of what Onoda experienced in the jungle. So it doesn’t quite have that heft of nonfiction.
But when I asked “Why did you write this as a novel?” he gave me the most Werner Herzogian answer that you can imagine. He basically said the way that time operated for Onoda, you couldn’t capture in film. This is what — I’ll give you the direct quote. He said, “We settle ourselves into a grand fiction of present time. It is a fiction. Technically, present time does not exist. Our sense of present time is technically impossible, because when you lift a foot from the ground, lifting it up has already passed. Setting it down on the ground is already future.”
So he felt like this was something that he couldn’t capture in film. He needed to explore the strange mental space that Onoda was experiencing, as well as the way time can speed up or slow down in the jungle. Herzog has spent a lot of time in the jungle himself. So he decided a novel was the way to do it. I think there was also a practical reason, which was that he wrote this book at the start of the pandemic, when his film production was shut down, and his wife Elena told him, basically, “You need to do something.” He’s a hyper-productive person, so he wrote this novel. And then right after, he wrote his autobiography, which is 300 pages and is being translated from German as we speak.
Oh, wow, so we’ll get that soon-ish.
It should be soon-ish, yes, and it has a fantastic title, which comes from one of his films. It’s “Every Man for Himself, and God Against All.”
[LAUGHS]: So, OK, given that title and the quote you read— I assume that many of our listeners are familiar with Herzog. And I don’t know whether “persona” is the right word, because it seems to just be him. It’s not something he puts on. He’s a very interesting guy with a very interesting way of seeing the world and speaking about it. What was it like to meet him? I assume you did this over video?
We did it over video because he was in Austria in the mountains where he had just finished recording the audiobook of “The Twilight World” and of his memoir. He did a German version of the memoir and then the English version of the audiobook. He was a fascinating person to talk to, and also a challenging interview subject because — this has come up in other interviews he’s done, of course. He’s given many over the years—
but he says — and it’s true from my experience — he’s very averse to self-reflection and introspection.
So if you try to probe why he’s interested in certain subjects or the way that he works or what inspires him, he really has very little patience for those questions. He really wants to talk about either these figures that he has lionized in his work, either in his films or now in his novel, or what they represent. So a lot of his reflections on those characters are very philosophical. He will not waste any time on small talk or talking about himself.
So there isn’t any small talk, which isn’t surprising to me, but is there any sense of warmth? Or is it just like talking to an intimidating oracle?
No, he was quite good-humored. And it’s exactly like you say. It’s not a persona that he puts on. This is simply who he is. And it’s very much like the voice that you hear narrating his documentary. The voice in his prose is very similar to that. I haven’t read his poetry, but I have to imagine it’s along those lines, too. So, yeah, it is kind of like engaging with the Werner Herzog that we’ve seen over the years.
That’s amazing. I really wish I could have been a fly on the Zoom while this was happening. But as always, people can go online and read the full piece of your interview with Herzog and your take on the book, which is really great in and of itself. Alexandra, thanks for being here.
Thanks so much for having me.

Two of The Times’s book critics are here, half of our fearsome foursome, Jennifer Szalai and Molly Young. Hello, you two.
Hi, John.
Hey, John.
So we’re going to get into the books you’ve most recently reviewed. Jen, you reviewed something that was fascinating, if a little gruesome. Is that a fair word?
Yeah, I guess gruesome is a fair word, although, I should say— so the book that I reviewed is called “The Facemaker.” And it basically tells the story, the life, of the reconstructive surgeon Harold Gillies, who, during World War I, mended the faces of those men who were sent to war and came back to England, which is where he was based.
Lindsey Fitzharris, who’s the author, she wrote a previous book called “The Butchering Art,” which was about Victorian medicine and how there was this deepening understanding of the role of germs, essentially, and how that made a huge difference. And so this book, I feel like, is an appropriate sequel to that. Gillies was working at a time where there was a better understanding of how germs actually worked, but this was before antibiotics.
So he was treating men who were subject to this new technology during World War I. It was a new kind of warfare. And so these were men who, because there was a better understanding of antiseptics, they might survive injuries that, in the past, would have been completely fatal. And so he was dealing with really severe facial injuries. Some of these men couldn’t necessarily eat because they had jaws that no longer existed. Some of them weren’t able to close their eyes to sleep because something had happened to their eyelids.
So she tells the story of how he basically improvised a new approach to surgery. And he wasn’t alone. She does talk about other doctors, other specialists, like dentists, who really pushed this field forward. And it’s completely fascinating. I mean, she’s a really good storyteller. She apparently even has her own television show, called “The Curious Life and Death Of” on the Smithsonian Channel, which I haven’t seen. But she’s clearly interested in matters of life, death, medicine, all that kind of stuff.
And at pivotal moments in that history. You said that she mentions the other people who helped him out. And obviously, there are many pioneers in this field. But why do you think she centers the book on Gillies? Because of his pioneering work or his personality or both?
I think it’s a combination of things. I think first of all, he was really collaborative. And I think that she wants to emphasize that even though there were other surgeons who were working to repair facial disfigurements during the war, he was somebody who really felt it was necessary to collaborate with others and to see facial surgery as interdisciplinary. And so I think she thinks that that’s very important.
Also, I think as a doctor with a particular bedside manner, I mean, he really understood that facial injuries were different from other kinds of wartime injuries. Amputees during World War I were often held up as heroes, whereas people whose faces were essentially totally unrecognizable were often treated as reminders, like actual graphic reminders, of the carnage during the war. So they were often avoided, shunned. And so he really took it upon himself not just to treat the physical injuries, but to give them the kind of psychological encouragement that a lot of these men— she consults some of their papers— it was very, very meaningful to them.
Is it a story, the way she tells it, that feels sort of mostly like a narrative science history? Or is that human element really stressed throughout? I mean, I imagine there’s something very moving about his relationships with some of these men, and certainly, what they’re going through.
She is very interested in the human element. And it is very moving, especially when she covers the experience of some of the men who found themselves in his care. And so she recreates what actually happened to them and how they found themselves being treated by him. But at the same time, he sort of comes across — and this might be what he was actually like as a person— but he definitely comes across as a hero. You don’t get a sense of interpersonal drama.
Really, the suspense of the narrative takes place in terms of, is he going to be able to help this person? And she recreates some of his experiences in the operating theater in such a way that really gives you a sense that what he was doing was new. And he really had to figure out a lot of these things on the fly. And it was really important to him to prepare. I think he recognized that in order to improvise, he had to have certain structures in place. But then once he got into the operating room, he really just had to pay very close attention to what was going on and to the specifics of each patient’s experience.
Yeah, well, and some of the things he pioneered are really incredible, reading about them in your review. I’ll close by asking on a scale of one to 10, squeamishly, how high up do you have to be before this becomes a tough read?
It’s pretty intense, I would say. Fitzharris, I give her credit because you could be really voyeuristic with this book, and she’s not really interested in that, although I think it’s really important for her, as well as for the narrative, to be specific and to evoke exactly what was going on, especially what made these facial wounds so difficult to treat. So she really does have to get into that stuff. I would say one to 10, maybe a six or seven.
But I should also say that there are a series of photographs in the book, which readers can skip because they’re all collected in the middle, where you actually get some of the photographs of the patients that were taken at the time. And the transformation that Gillies was able to make on some of these patients is really astonishing. But at the same time, you look at what they started out with. And I can imagine that it was really difficult for a lot of these patients to handle.
Hmm. Molly, you reviewed a book that is also about a fascinating subject, obviously one that is less life or death oriented, but one that especially I think people who grew up — and the three of us, our general age group, looping Jen and I into your younger cohort— we all grew up with this structure very much in our lives. What book did you write about this week?
I wrote about a book called “Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall,” by the design critic Alexandra Lange.
And this is a, as the subtitle says, an inside history. So what is the purpose here, to draw us from the earliest malls to the current day? And is there a larger argument behind the book, pro-mall or anti-mall?
She does end up making a pro-mall argument, but it’s a qualified argument. So the book begins with kind of an overview of what the mall was and how it came to be. And then it moves on to discuss how this architectural innovation evolved, or devolved, and how it shaped the way people behaved inside spaces.
And I was talking about the book with somebody, and I mentioned the sort of timeline, which is that malls, as we think of them, are a post-World War II invention. And my friend was like, “Oh, that’s so weird. I thought malls had been around for much longer than that.” And then I was talking with someone else. And they were like, “Oh, that’s weird. I thought malls were invented in the ‘80s.”
That’s what I would have said.
There were department stores in the 1800s, and those were kind of a pre-mall idea where you had big stores that had all sorts of various items in them. And the idea was that people could spend a long time browsing and not leaving the store. But what we think of as the shopping mall or complex, it’s a very specific thing. It’s a collection of stores that are connected by recreational spaces, like food courts and greenery and playgrounds. It has tons of parking.
There are certain shapes that malls tend to have. There’s the classic dumbbell shape, which is where you have an anchor tenant at either side. There’s U-shaped malls and O-shaped malls. And I think there’s one Z-shaped mall, which is an anomaly.
Terrifying.
Terrifying.
I certainly think of malls as something that had their big boom time in the ‘80s, maybe into the ‘90s. But what were the post-World War II, what were the big innovations? And when did they happen? Where were they?
So they happened in the Midwest. All roads lead back to this one guy named Victor Gruen, who fled Vienna in the late 1930s and arrived in New York. And he’d studied architecture, so he started working in retail. And the interesting thing about Gruen is that politically and culturally, he was very much a socialist. And so it’s funny that this is a guy that basically invents the great American temple of consumerism.
But on the other hand, Lange points out that this is also a guy who’s a fan of very large, top-down planning efforts. And if you look at his earliest proposals for malls, these were spaces that weren’t just shops, but they also had post offices and schools and community centers and dentists. And so, in his conception, there is always a civic dimension to the mall that, obviously, later went away because it wasn’t contributing to the cash spent per square foot.
He wasn’t just interested in pretzels and CDs is what you’re saying?
Amazingly, no, no.
Through the book, you introduced me to this concept called the Gruen transfer, which puts a very specific term to something that I felt in my soul many times. What is that?
Oh, yes, the Gruen transfer. This is something that he probably would not want attached to his name. But it’s a description of what happens basically when you enter a shopping center with a goal in mind. Like, I want to buy a stereo. And then by exposure to other things, you end up buying something else and something else and something else, maybe a Mrs. Fields cookie and then maybe a pair of earrings on your way back out. And it’s the idea of shopping transforming from a task to a form of recreation, and how all the sort of temptations of the mall are designed to make that transfer happen.
You said that it is pro-mall, but with qualifications. I would say that the anti-mall case, at least the way I’ve heard it from people over the years, could be summed up as, it’s a bit soulless. That Gruen transfer, I guess, the negative side of that is that you end up just spending your money on some useless things. But what are the arguments that Lange makes for revivifying malls? Because a lot of them have been abandoned and are defunct now. But she wants to, I assume, bring them back with some qualifications.
Exactly, and she mentions this whole genre of dead mall, zombie mall photography and exploration, which, if you go on YouTube or Reddit, there’s a thriving community of people who take photos of decaying malls. And it’s true that, I mean, they are very difficult to repurpose. It’s not easy to turn a mall into housing or a school because it’s such a specific structure.
But she points out something really interesting, which is also something that Joan Didion pointed out in her essay about malls. And the idea is that these commercial imperatives around malls accidentally created a form of space that accommodated people who don’t otherwise have a lot of societal power. So the young, the old, the disabled, the poor. A mall has to be compliant, so there have to be ramps and easily accessible elevators and signage.
And it’s also climate controlled, so if you live somewhere where there are extremes of weather, you can go into a mall for free, in theory, and escape that. There’s bathrooms, some form of security. Sometimes it’s a good thing. Sometimes it’s a bad thing. But at one point, teenagers could go to a mall and their parents would allow them to do that, because there would be mall cops. And so there is the assurance that nobody would get into too much trouble. Of course, the other side of that is that mall cops can be forces of harassment and irritation, especially for skateboarders.
You sound like you speak from experience there, but we won’t get into that.
Yeah, so the idea is that in theory, a mall could be a very welcoming place. And it could perform a service. But in reality, there are a lot of reasons why that tends not to be the case.
I did find myself while I was reading your review, you were sort of enunciating some of these things about what a mall can be. And it was as if the concept hadn’t existed before. And I thought, wow, this really does sound like a great idea. So maybe there is a way to bring it back and just keep the great stuff and ameliorate some of the bad stuff somehow. Let’s go over again the books you reviewed most recently.
I reviewed “The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I,” by Lindsey Fitzharris.
I reviewed “Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall,” by Alexandra Lange. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Elisabeth Egan, an editor at the Book Review, curates our Group Text column — a monthly choice of a book that she feels is particularly well suited to book clubs and their discussions. On this week’s podcast, she talks about her latest pick: “Jackie & Me,” by Louis Bayard, which imagines the friendship between Jacqueline Bouvier and Lem Billings, a close friend of the Kennedys. 
“This is rooted in reality,” Egan says, “but Bayard runs with it and imagines conversations between Lem and Jackie, and just shows this, on one hand, fabulous life of parties and museums and fun they had together, but also sets up this ticking clock where you come to understand what Jackie really has at stake, and has to lose, by committing to this life with the Kennedys.”
Matthew Schneier visits the podcast to discuss Paula Byrne’s new biography, “The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym.” Pym, a British writer, began publishing novels in the 1950s.
“She published six novels in pretty quick succession, and they’re great,” Schneier says of the first decade or so of her career. “Very clever, very witty, she was often compared to Jane Austen — which was a writer that she loved and appreciated, but also a kind of very easy comparison, whereas Pym’s ironies can be a little bit darker than some of Austen’s. And there’s a sense in her work that she is spotlighting characters who are not the Emma Woodhouses, who are beautiful and rich and effervescent. They’re what she ended up calling ‘excellent women,’ which is the title of I think her best starter novel. These women who are well brought up and very proper, a little bit pious, but can also be a little dowdy, a little dreary, a little bit easier to overlook.”
Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter talks about the filmmaker Werner Herzog and his first novel, “The Twilight World”; and Jennifer Szalai and Molly Young talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. John Williams is the host.
Here are the books discussed by The Times’s critics this week:
“The Facemaker” by Lindsey Fitzharris
“Meet Me by the Fountain” by Alexandra Lange
