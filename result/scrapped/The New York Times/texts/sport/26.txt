A reader asks: My husband loves his Chemex, but the carafe doesn’t keep coffee hot. What are my options?
The Chemex produces nuanced coffee, and its high-quality borosilicate glass doesn’t crack under temperature swings. But it’s not insulated, so it does start to lose heat before you’ve even finished brewing the pot.
Start with a kettle that keeps its temperature. Wirecutter’s favorite kettles do, but 200 °F water will quickly lose heat in inferior kettles, resulting in cooler and less delicious coffee because grounds aren’t fully extracted.
You can also prewarm your carafe and drinking vessel. Pour boiling water into your Chemex carafe and let it sit for a minute, then dump it out when you’re just about to brew your coffee. Do the same for your mug.
The Chemex’s glass is designed to take direct heat, so you can also keep your coffee warm on the stove. If you’re going to put the carafe on a burner, though, make sure you have coffee in it first to prevent the glass from cracking.
Accessories can help your carafe stay snuggly. Hexnub makes a lid and cozy, which I tested against an unadorned Chemex. After 90 minutes, the dressed-up Chemex kept coffee about 20 degrees hotter than the undressed one.
Check out some of Wirecutter’s favorite electric kettles.
