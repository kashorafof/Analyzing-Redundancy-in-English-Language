Moscow said its military had repaired hundreds of miles of track, and a key freshwater source is flowing again to Russian-occupied Crimea. Connecting Russia to territory captured in southern Ukraine would accomplish one of Moscow’s major objectives in the war.

Even as Russia hammers eastern Ukraine with heavy artillery, it is cementing its grip on the south, claiming to have restored roads, rails and a critical freshwater canal that could help it claim permanent dominion over the region.
The extension of Russian infrastructure into the occupied south could allow Moscow to fortify a “land bridge” between Russia and Crimea and build on efforts to claim control through the introduction of Russian currency and the appointment of proxy officials.
Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said on Tuesday that the military, working with Russian Railways, had repaired about 750 miles of track in southeastern Ukraine and set the conditions for traffic to flow from Russia through Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region to occupied territory in Kherson and Crimea.
Mr. Shoigu also said that water was once again flowing to Crimea through the North Crimean Canal — an important source of freshwater that Ukraine cut off in 2014 after the Kremlin annexed the peninsula. Mr. Shoigu claimed that car traffic was now open between “continental” Russia and Crimea.
Mr. Shoigu’s claims of restored roads and rails could not be immediately verified.
Satellite imagery reviewed by The New York Times showed that water was flowing through the parts of the canal in Crimea that were dry until March. Russian engineers blew open a blockage in the canal in late February, days after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
The North Crimean Canal, a 250-mile-long engineering marvel built under the Soviet Union, had channeled water from Ukraine’s Dnipro River to the arid Crimean Peninsula until President Vladimir V. Putin seized it in 2014.
After Crimea’s annexation, Ukraine dropped bags of sand and clay into the canal to prevent the Russian occupiers from benefiting from the valuable freshwater.
Instead of flowing to Crimea, the canal was used to irrigate the melon fields and peach orchards in Ukraine’s Kherson region to the north.
Ukrainian officials said that cutting off the water was one of the few levers at their disposal to inflict pain on Russia without using military force.
For the Kremlin, the blockage represented a vexing and expensive infrastructure challenge, with Crimea’s residents suffering chronic water shortages and occasional shut-offs at the tap.
When Mr. Putin massed troops on Ukraine’s border last year, some analysts speculated that the canal was one of the prizes the Kremlin wanted.
Even as Russia sought to entrench its control in the south this week, a clandestine battle has emerged inside the occupied regions, involving Kremlin loyalists, occupying Russian forces, Ukrainian partisans and the Ukrainian military.
On Tuesday, Ukrainian media posted video of what they said was an explosion at a cafe in the occupied city of Kherson that had served as a gathering place for people collaborating with Russian forces. Russian state media described it as an act of “terror.”
It was the latest in a series of attacks targeting Russian supporters and proxies. It came amid reports — most impossible to independently verify — of Ukrainian guerrillas blowing up bridges, targeting rail lines used by Russian forces and killing Russian soldiers on patrol.
Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said that there was a focused guerrilla movement operating in the south. “Partisans are fighting very actively,” he said on his YouTube channel.
In the east, where both armies are fighting for control, Ukrainian officials were weighing whether to withdraw their forces in the city of Sievierodonetsk, the last major pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the Luhansk region.
Sievierodonetsk has been blasted by weeks of Russian shelling, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine referred to the city and its neighbor, Lysychansk, on Monday as “dead cities,” physically destroyed and nearly empty of civilians.
“Fighting is still raging and no one is going to give up the city, even if our military has to step back to stronger positions,” Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian military governor of the Luhansk region, said on Ukrainian television, according to Reuters.
Moscow’s announcement that it was extending its ties to the occupied south seemed certain to be greeted in Ukraine as further evidence of Russia’s determination to break Ukraine apart and pillage its natural resources.
“Russia is trying to build infrastructure for military supply,” said Mykhailo Samus, deputy director for international affairs at the Center for Army Studies, Conversion and Disarmament, a research group in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.
“Maybe they try to steal the agriculture, food products from occupied territories,” he added.
The Russian authorities said that the first train had traveled from the occupied city of Melitopol to Crimea carrying grain — freight that Ukrainian officials say was stolen from Ukrainian farmers forced to hand over their crops for a pittance or nothing at all.
Russia has blockaded Ukraine’s Black Sea ports since the start of the war, trapping more than 20 million tons of grain meant for export and deepening a global food crisis. Dimming the long-term outlook, grain silos in Ukraine are still about half full, the Ukraine Grain Association said on Wednesday, raising the possibility that much of this year’s crop could be left in the fields.
On Wednesday, the Russian and Turkish foreign ministers held talks focused on allowing Ukraine’s grain to reach global markets through the Black Sea.
But the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, minimized the issue, suggesting that a global food catastrophe caused by a Russian blockade was a Western exaggeration.
“The current situation has nothing to do with the food crisis,” Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference in Ankara, the Turkish capital. “The Russian Federation is not creating any obstacles for the passage of ships and vessels.”
He blamed Ukraine, saying that its naval mines and refusal to use humanitarian corridors offered by Russia in Black Sea shipping lanes were stalling exports.
The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, disagreed, saying that there was a global problem, but that it involved both Russian and Ukrainian products.
“The food crisis in the world is a real crisis,” Mr. Cavusoglu said, noting that Russia and Ukraine together supply about one-third of the world’s grain products.
Mr. Cavusoglu said that a mechanism was needed to get not just agricultural products from Ukraine out through the Black Sea, but also Russian fertilizer, which is vital for global agriculture.
He suggested that the answer lay in a United Nations proposal that the international community provide guarantees for the shipments that addressed security concerns on both sides.
Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Ankara, and its government and Russia’s each blame the other for the lack of exports.
The two countries normally supply about 40 percent of wheat needs in Africa, according to the United Nations.
Ukrainian officials are deeply skeptical of a promise by Mr. Putin, which Mr. Lavrov repeated, that if harbors were demined, Russia would not exploit them to dispatch an invasion fleet. Russian warships have also been patrolling Black Sea shipping lanes.
Oleksii Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said on Twitter on Wednesday, “Our position on the supply of grain is clear: security first.” He accused Russia of “artificially creating obstacles to seize the market and blackmail Europe over food shortages.”
The United States has cited satellite imagery of cargo ships to accuse Russia of looting Ukrainian wheat stocks that it exported, mostly to Africa, echoing Ukrainian government allegations that Russia has stolen up to 500,000 tons of wheat, worth $100 million, since it invaded Ukraine in February.
Wheat is not the only Ukrainian resource prompting alarm. As Ukraine braces for what promises to be a difficult winter, Mr. Zelensky said that the country would not sell its gas or coal abroad. “All domestic production will be directed to the internal needs of our citizens,” he said.

American citizens, permanent residents and companies are prohibited from buying Russian stocks and bonds, the Treasury Department said in guidance published on Monday.
New investments are forbidden, but Americans are not required to divest from Russian debt or securities, and they can sell their holdings to foreigners, according to the guidance, which is the latest addition to a raft of financial sanctions that the U.S. government has placed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.
On Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Russia’s main stock index lost a third of its value, a trend celebrated by the Biden administration, which has sought to impose what it described at the time as “severe and immediate economic costs on Russia” in response to the war. Russia closed its stock market on Feb. 28 and reopened it under limited circumstances almost a month later.
The Treasury Department guidance suggests that some Americans have been betting that the market has overreacted to the war in Ukraine, said Paolo Pasquariello, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, who is studying the economic fallout of the war. He pointed out that the Russian ruble collapsed soon after the onset of the war but has since rebounded, meaning some investors could have earned a significant return by betting on the ruble.
He described these investors as likely subscribers to the Latin expression of amoral financial motivation, “pecunia non olet” — money does not stink.
The measure is likely to affect only the wealthiest Russians, Professor Pasquariello said. The stock market in Russia is underdeveloped, and is most relevant to members of the elite who invest in a small number of companies, many of them in oil and gas, he said. Average Russians tend not to invest their savings there, he added.
Some U.S. sanctions, like banning the importation of Russian oil, coal and natural gas, are aimed at hurting Russia’s ability to fund its war, he said, while others, like seizing the yachts of oligarchs and making it harder for them to sell stocks and bonds, are intended to punish and put pressure on the country’s elite.
Russian oligarchs know that their assets are losing value and would like to sell them, but sanctions are limiting their options, Professor Pasquariello said. “Yachts are becoming very illiquid, because they cannot retrieve them and sell them.”
“Something similar is happening with Russian stocks and bonds,” he added. “They will not find buyers.”

Russian shelling killed five people and injured 12 in the Ukrainian region of Kharkiv over a 24-hour period, with one dead and six injured in the city of Kharkiv, Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the region, said in a message on Telegram posted Wednesday. The city of Kharkiv had been relatively quiet in recent weeks.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressed American executives via video link at Yale’s C.E.O. Summit on Wednesday, urging them not to do business with Russia. “It is very important for me to see that such an audience — and these, I emphasize again, are representatives of the most influential part of American business — believes that sanctions against Russia should be strengthened,” Zelensky said in his nightly address to Ukrainians.

The European Parliament recommended that Ukraine be granted candidate status for membership in the European Union, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Twitter. The symbolic vote comes ahead of the E.U.’s decision on Ukraine’s candidacy, which is expected in late June.
The European Parliament recommended granting #EU candidate status for 🇺🇦! Deputies approved the resolution also calling for providing weapons to #Ukraine to fight the aggressor. Grateful to @EP_President & @Europarl_EN for solidarity with Ukrainian people. We will win together!

Russian forces have restored a piece of Ukrainian infrastructure vital to the “land bridge” that Moscow seeks to establish linking Russian territory to the Crimean Peninsula: a canal that supplies water from southern Ukraine to the peninsula, according to satellite images and a statement on Tuesday by the Kremlin’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu.
For years, the 250-mile-long Northern Crimean Canal had channeled water from Ukraine’s Dnipro River to the arid peninsula of Crimea. Built by thousands of construction workers from across the Soviet Union, it was a marvel of engineering, dropping about an inch for every mile for the first half of its length to keep the water flowing.
All that changed after Russia, under President Vladimir V. Putin, annexed the peninsula in 2014.
Ukraine responded by damming the canal with bags of sand and clay to prevent the now Russian-occupied peninsula from benefiting from the valuable freshwater. Instead of flowing to Crimea, the water in the canal was used to irrigate the melon fields and peach orchards of Ukraine’s Kherson region, to Crimea’s north.
Ukrainian officials said that cutting off the water was one of the few levers at their disposal to inflict pain on Moscow after the annexation without using military force.
For the Kremlin, the blockage of the canal was a vexing and expensive challenge. Crimea’s residents began to suffer chronic water shortages and occasional shut-offs at the tap.
In early 2021, as Mr. Putin massed troops on the Ukrainian border in preparation for the invasion, some analysts speculated that restoring the flow of water in the canal might have been a major objective for Moscow.Russian engineers blew open the dam in late February, days after Russian forces invaded Ukraine and took control of the area around Kherson.
Satellite imagery reviewed by The New York Times shows that water is now flowing through parts of the canal that had been dry since 2014.

WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has provided near-daily updates of Russia’s invasion on social media. Viral video posts have shown the effectiveness of Western weapons in the hands of Ukrainian forces. And the Pentagon has regularly held briefings on developments in the war.
But despite the flow of all this news to the public, American intelligence agencies have less information than they would like about Ukraine’s operations and possess a far better picture of Russia’s military, its planned operations and its successes and failures, according to current and former officials.
Governments often withhold information from the public for operational security. But these information gaps within the U.S. government could make it more difficult for the Biden administration to decide how to target military aid as it sends billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine.
U.S. officials said the Ukrainian government gave them few classified briefings or details about their operational plans, and Ukrainian officials acknowledged that they did not tell the Americans everything.
Of course the U.S. intelligence community collects information about nearly every country, including Ukraine.
But American spy agencies, in general, focus their collection efforts on adversarial governments, like Russia, not current friends, like Ukraine. And while Russia has been a top priority for American spies for 75 years, when it came to the Ukrainians, the United States has worked on building up their intelligence service, not spying on their government.

Radiation detectors at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine are back online for the first time since the Russian invasion more than 100 days ago, and radiation levels are normal, the head of the international nuclear watchdog agency said on Wednesday.
Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, called the resumption of radiation data transmission “a very positive step forward for nuclear safety and security in Ukraine.”
“It ends a long period of virtual information blackout that created much uncertainty about the radiation situation in the area, especially when it was under Russian occupation,” he said.
The detectors stopped working on Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion. Russian forces set up encampments and dug trenches in the forests around the plant, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. Russian troops left on March 31.
Mr. Grossi and international experts have expressed alarm over the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors. This week, Ukraine also raised renewed concerns about the safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which is currently under the control of Russian forces.
Ukraine told the I.A.E.A. on Monday that it had “lost control over” nuclear material at Zaporizhzhia and that data communication with the plant on nuclear safeguards had broken down. Nuclear safeguard mechanisms are essential to ensure that nuclear facilities are not misused and nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful uses, the agency said. Ukraine also said the supply chain for spare parts to the plant had been disrupted.
Mr. Grossi noted the concerns on Monday in an address to the agency’s board of governors.
“I have repeatedly expressed my grave concern at the extremely stressful and challenging working conditions under which Ukrainian management and staff are operating the plant,” he said. “One clear line of Ukrainian operational control and responsibility is vital, not only for the safety and security of Zaporizhzhya NPP, but also so that I.A.E.A. inspectors are able to continue to fulfill their regular, indispensable verification activities.”
Ukrainian energy officials reacted angrily this week after Mr. Grossi said that he was working with the Russian authorities to organize an emergency visit to the Zaporizhzhia facility.
Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator, said in a statement that such a visit would only “legitimize the stay of the occupiers.”
There are eight operational nuclear reactors currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, including two at Zaporizhzhia, according to the agency.
Underscoring the danger posed by the Russian bombardment of Ukraine, the country informed international regulators on Sunday that a cruise missile was observed flying above the plant.
“If a missile goes astray near a nuclear power plant, it could have a severe impact on its physical integrity, potentially leading to a nuclear accident,” Mr. Grossi said on Wednesday.

Reporting from Bakhmut, Ukraine
The sounds of war echo throughout Bakhmut, a largely deserted city in eastern Ukraine, just 10 miles from the front. Even with a trained ear, it is hard to tell what artillery fire is outgoing or incoming.
The terror can be all the more acute for the vulnerable and those unable to care for themselves, among them Zinaida Riabtseva, 77, who is blind and cannot leave her fifth-floor apartment on her own.
As Russian forces bear down with intensifying ferocity in an effort to control the Donbas region, which borders Russia, aid workers are scrambling to evacuate the old, the infirm and the disabled. Those who leave their homes do not know if they will ever be able to return, joining the more than 12 million Ukrainians who have been displaced by Russia’s invasion.
Last week, British and Ukrainian volunteers with the aid group Vostok-SOS were called in to evacuate Ms. Riabtseva, along with her husband, Yuriy. After carefully placing her on a stretcher, volunteers carried her down five flights of stairs, while her husband followed behind with a few pieces of luggage.
Since the invasion began in February, Vostok-SOS has evacuated 15,000 people from eastern Ukraine. On one such evacuation mission, Vostok staff recently drove through back lanes to reach the home of their latest evacuee, Mykhaylo Silichkin.
When they arrived in front of his tidy house, he hopped out through the front gate on his crutches, a cigarette perched in his mouth. One volunteer picked up his prosthetic leg. Others carried his luggage.
Mr. Silichkin locked the gate as he left, not knowing if he would ever return.

Angela Merkel says she will not apologize for her policies during her 16 years as Germany’s chancellor, rebuffing criticism that they were somehow responsible for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in her first extensive comments to the public since leaving office last year.
“I don’t need to blame myself,” Ms. Merkel told an audience on Tuesday at the Berliner Ensemble theater in Berlin during an interview with a reporter from Der Spiegel magazine.
“I tried hard,” she said. “It’s a great shame that it didn’t work.”
Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, Germany’s political class has been forced to rethink its decades-long approach to Moscow, seen as a policy of “change through trade.” Critics long argued it was too soft on Moscow.
Ms. Merkel has come under fire for pushing German-Russian business interests during her tenure — in particular, for supporting the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Both Ukraine and eastern European neighbors objected to the Kremlin-backed project, which Berlin froze after the invasion.
In the interview, Ms. Merkel said she was never under the illusion that “change through trade” would soften President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and she defended maintaining at least some trade relations. She toughened her stance toward Moscow after war broke out with Ukraine in 2014, but “you cannot ignore each other completely,” she said.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has sought to portray the approach as leading to the February invasion.
In April, after atrocities were documented in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha as Russian forces retreated, Mr. Zelensky said, “I invite Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha, to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to,” referring to Nicolas Sarkozy, who was president of France from 2007 to 2012.
Ms. Merkel did not shy away from self-reproach in the interview. She cited the fact that “it has not been possible to create a successful security architecture” as a failure of her government. The former chancellor said she was now left asking herself: “Could more have been done to prevent such a tragedy?”
She defended one of her most criticized moves relating to Ukraine — her opposition to Ukraine and Georgia being given a formal “membership action plan” to join NATO in 2008. She and other leaders argued that the countries were not ready, and that such a move would have disrupted relations with Moscow. It “would have equated to a declaration of war” for Mr. Putin, she said in the interview.
Ultimately, all NATO member states agreed not to offer a membership action plan to the two countries, but promised them membership at some point in the future.
Ms. Merkel said that Ukraine had dangerously divided between pro-reform political forces and forces closer to Russia, and that its democracy would not have withstood a Russian invasion as it has today.
She also defended her role in negotiating the Minsk peace accords in the Belarusian capital in 2014 and 2015, an effort to resolve a war in the Donbas region that did not stop the hostilities. She said Mr. Putin might have caused huge damage in Ukraine if the agreements were not in place.
“Diplomacy isn’t wrong just because it doesn’t succeed,” she said. “So I don’t see why I should say that was wrong, and I won’t apologize for it.”

The Russian and Turkish foreign ministers disagreed on Wednesday on the extent of the global food crisis after talks focused on getting Ukraine grain exports crucial to the global food supply moving through the Black Sea.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, sought to play down the entire issue, suggesting that a global food catastrophe caused by a Russian blockade was a Western exaggeration.
“The current situation has nothing to do with the food crisis,” Mr. Lavrov told a news conference in Ankara, the Turkish capital. “The Russian Federation is not creating any obstacles for the passage of ships and vessels.”
He placed all the blame on Ukraine, saying that its naval mines and refusal to use humanitarian corridors offered by Russia in the Black Sea shipping lanes were stalling shipments.
The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, disagreed with Mr. Lavrov, saying that there was a global problem, but that it involved both Russian and Ukrainian products. “The food crisis in the world is a real crisis,” Mr. Cavusoglu said, noting that Russia and Ukraine together supply about one-third of the world’s grain products.
The Turkish foreign minister said that a mechanism needed to be found to get not just agricultural products from Ukraine out through the Black Sea, but also Russian fertilizer, which is vital for global supplies.
Russia and Ukraine each blame the other for the lack of exports. The two countries normally supply about 40 percent of wheat needs in Africa, where prices for the grain have risen 23 percent in the past year, according to the United Nations. On Friday, the head of the African Union, President Macky Sall of Senegal, met in Russia with President Vladimir V. Putin in an effort to secure grain supplies.
It is not clear that the mines are all Ukrainian, and the government in Kyiv is deeply skeptical of a promise from Mr. Putin, which Mr. Lavrov repeated, that Russia would not exploit any demined harbors to dispatch an invasion fleet. Russian warships have also been patrolling Black Sea shipping lanes.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, noted on Twitter on Tuesday that Mr. Putin had also said earlier this year that he would not invade Ukraine. “We cannot trust Putin, his words are empty,” Mr. Kuleba wrote.
And Oleksii Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said on Twitter on Wednesday, “Our position on the supply of grain is clear: security first.” He also accused Russia of “artificially creating obstacles to seize the market and blackmail Europe over food shortages.”
Mr. Cavusoglu suggested at the news conference that the answer lay in a United Nations proposal that the international community provide guarantee for the shipments that addressed security concerns on both sides. As with the wheat crisis, there was no indication that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine last held in Turkey in late March would resume soon.
The United States has used satellite imagery of cargo ships to accuse Russia of looting Ukrainian wheat stocks that it exported, mostly to Africa, echoing Ukrainian government allegations that Russia has stolen up to 500,000 tons of wheat, worth $100 million, since its military invaded Ukraine in February.

As Russia continues to pound towns and villages across eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin is trying to deepen its hold on occupied territory in the south, restoring transportation links and other key infrastructure to secure a “land bridge” from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.
Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said on Tuesday that its military, working with Russian Railways, had repaired about 750 miles of track in southeastern Ukraine and set the conditions for “full-fledged traffic” to flow from Russia, through Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, to occupied territory in Kherson and on to Crimea.
He also said that water was once again flowing to Crimea through the North Crimean Canal — an essential source of freshwater that Ukraine cut off in 2014 after the Kremlin annexed the peninsula, a move that Ukraine and its Western allies have termed illegal. Mr. Shoigu claimed that car traffic was now open between “continental” Russia and Crimea.
None of his claims could be independently confirmed, and the Russia-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksenov, said on Wednesday that the road for car traffic was “suitable for military purposes and food delivery purposes,” but that it would be some time before it could be used by civilians.
For Ukrainians, the announcements were a further demonstration that Russia intended to break Ukraine apart and pillage its natural resources. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blockaded since the start of the war, and more than 20 million tons of grain meant for export are trapped there, deepening a global food crisis.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, called the Russian blockade of Ukrainian grain “a cold, callous and calculated siege by Putin on some of the world’s most vulnerable countries and people in the world.” 
In other developments:
Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, held talks on Wednesday with Turkish officials but announced no progress toward allowing grain exports from Ukraine. Russia has enforced a blockade of Ukraine’s coast and Ukraine has mined the ports to prevent a Russian incursion by sea. Ukraine, which was not invited to the discussions in Turkey, has expressed fear that opening up a sea corridor for exports could be used as a pretext to weaken its coastal defenses.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that Ukraine would not be selling its gas or coal abroad as it prepared for what promises to be a difficult winter. “All domestic production will be directed to the internal needs of our citizens,” he said.
The World Bank on Tuesday approved $1.49 billion of additional financing for Ukraine, part of the total support package of over $4 billion. Nearly $2 billion of the funding has already been disbursed.

Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the E.U.’s executive branch, called the Russian blockade of Ukrainian grain “a cold, callous and calculated siege by Putin on some of the world’s most vulnerable countries and people in the world.” Speaking in the European Parliament, Ms. von der Leyen fought back against accusations that E.U. sanctions are fueling the global food crisis: “It is our duty to dismantle Russia’s disinformation. Our sanctions do not touch basic food commodities.”

Reporting from Peremoha, Ukraine
Russian soldiers occupied Peremoha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, on Feb. 28. A few days later, they dragged Oleksandr Yermolchyk, the village priest, from his basement at gunpoint, demanding that he show them who was informing on Russian troop positions from the church. They didn’t find anyone. But the Russians shelled the church anyway.
Built in 1892, the blue wooden church survived revolution, civil war, and several generations of atheistic communism. But since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it has had its door shot through and a crater left in its floor.
The church still smells of the incense and wax candles popular with Orthodox believers. But more than two months after the Russians retreated from Peremoha — lobbing more mortars as they withdrew — the building is full of broken glass and rubble. Pigeons gained access to the rafters from holes in the onion-domed cupola.
A Ukrainian flag now hangs outside, added by the builders who installed a new door after the original was taken to Kyiv to be used as part of an exhibition about the war.
Father Yermolchyk said that one Russian soldier named Kirill had taken some care inside the church. He kept some of the icons safe and left a letter asking to be remembered in the priest’s prayers.
“I pray for some Russians,” Father Yermolchyk said. “But definitely not for Putin,” he added, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.
Father Yermolchyk managed to escape from Peremoha on March 9, while the village was still surrounded. After sheltering for two weeks in his basement, he walked several miles with eight other people through fields of tall grass, traversing streams with a child on his back, to get to Ukrainian-held territory. About 300 people, including Father Yermolchyk, have returned to the village, he said. Its population before the war was four times that size.
He and other villagers have been digging up shrapnel and the casings from anti-tank artillery shells every day, he said. They uncovered so much metal, Father Yermolchyk said, that he donated it to a company that plans to make furniture out of it.
Nearby, along the main road, lies a pile of rubble where the post office stood. Seven people were shot to death there, Father Yermolchyk said. Their bodies remained inside until the Russians withdrew, detonating a bomb in the basement when they left. The families of the dead could recognize their loved ones only by the remnants of their clothing.
Did the destruction cause his congregants’ faith to waver?
“After the occupation we lived through, people are so much more full of love for one another,” he said. “Yes, what we lived through was so hard, but people have become more sympathetic and helped one another.”
He added, “Still, in their heads, people carry a lot of darkness.”

In anticipation of a difficult winter, Ukraine will be reserving its gas and coal for domestic use instead of exporting it, President Zelensky said in his nightly address. The country will also seek to increase its electricity exports, rebuild power plants damaged by the war and prevent increases to residents’ gas and electricity tariffs, he said.

Ukraine will soon launch a data collection system — a “Book of Executioners” — on Russian forces determined to have committed or ordered war crimes, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address. The system, which Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have said for months would be part of their efforts to hold Russia accountable, is set to launch next week.

An effort by right-wing lawmakers in Sweden to oust the justice minister via a no-confidence vote became embroiled in geopolitics on Tuesday, complicating Sweden’s bid to become part of the NATO military alliance after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
A lawmaker of Iranian-Kurdish origin abstained from the razor-close, no-confidence vote, defeating it and averting a political crisis for the government of Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.
But the lawmaker, Amineh Kakabaveh, exacted a price, first securing a commitment from the government that Sweden would not bow to Turkish demands tied to the NATO application.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has threatened to block Sweden and Finland from joining NATO, criticizing the nations for hosting Kurdish militants he views as his country’s main enemy.
Prime Minister Andersson admonished the backers of the no-confidence vote over their timing.
“We are in a very sensitive position for our NATO application,” she said, calling the move “utterly irresponsible.”
She said: “We are not in a position to play political games in Sweden. It’s dangerous.”
Sweden’s far-right parties had accused Ms. Andersson’s center-left government of failing to address increasing gun violence and crime in the country, tying it to rising levels of immigration, and had called for the justice minister, Morgan Johansson, to step down. Conservative parties also supported the no-confidence motion.

At least 4,253 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded in late February, and the true death toll is likely much higher, the United Nations human rights office said Tuesday. Another 5,141 have been injured. More than half of the casualties occurred in the two eastern regions that Russia is trying to capture. Most of the civilian deaths were caused by missile strikes, multiple-launch rocket strikes, artillery barrages and airstrikes, the U.N. said.

The intensity of artillery duels in Donbas was evident in newly released satellite images from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Fields outside Sloviansk, near the border between Donetsk and Luhansk, were peppered with craters caused by artillery explosions.

KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Just to enter Sievierodonetsk, Ukrainian soldiers run a gantlet of Russian artillery shells zeroed in on the only access route: a bridge littered with the burned husks of cars and trucks that didn’t make it.
And once inside the city in eastern Ukraine, the focus of both armies for the past several weeks, Ukrainian soldiers battle Russians in back-and forth combat for control of deserted, destroyed neighborhoods.
Ukraine’s leaders now face a key strategic decision: whether to withdraw from the midsize city and take up more defensible positions, or to remain and risk being boxed in if the bridge is blown up. It reflects the choices the country has had to make since the Russian invasion began, between giving ground to avert death and destruction in the short term, and holding out against long odds in hopes it will later pay off.
In Sievierodonetsk, that calculation has taken on significance beyond the city’s limited military importance. In remarks to journalists on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Sievierodonetsk and its neighbor across the river, Lysychansk, as “dead cities” ravaged by Russian attacks and nearly empty of civilians.
And yet he insisted there was a compelling reason to stay and fight: Ukraine’s position throughout the war has been that it intends to hold onto its sovereign territory, and not yield it to Moscow.
Retreating now to better positions on higher ground across the Seversky Donets River, and then fighting to retake the city later, he said, would be harder and carry a higher price in bloodshed than holding on.
“It will be very costly for you to return, in terms of the number of people killed, the number of losses,” Mr. Zelensky said.
“Our heroes are not giving up positions in Sievierodonetsk,” he added. “Fierce urban combat continues in the city.”
It was a rare public rumination by Mr. Zelensky on strategic decision-making in the war, providing a window into the goals of his government and its military. Sievierodonetsk is the last major city in the breakaway region of Luhansk that the Russians have not taken; capturing it would give them near-total control of that enclave.
There are other factors as well. Falling back could be demoralizing to Ukraine’s forces. And some Ukrainian soldiers said it is worth drawing out the phase of urban combat to inflict more casualties on the already depleted Russian forces, and possibly damage their morale.
It was also possible Mr. Zelensky was aiding the military with misdirection by signaling one intention while quietly pursuing an opposite course of action.
The government has not said how many military casualties Ukraine has suffered overall since the Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion in February. But Mr. Zelensky said last week that in the recent, intense fighting, each day his country was losing 60 to 100 soldiers killed and 500 wounded. Russia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Tuesday that 6,489 Ukrainian service members had been captured.
Ukraine’s Interior Ministry this week estimated civilian casualties at 40,000 killed or wounded, though some government officials say the true figures are higher. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that ruptured sewer and water pipes in the southern city of Mariupol, seized by Russia after a devastating siege, have created a risk of severe disease outbreaks that would raise the civilian toll.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, part of Luhansk and the broader Donbas region in the east, has raged now for weeks, and some Ukrainian soldiers have questioned why the army has not ordered a tactical retreat.
“They are killing a lot of our guys,” said a soldier who asked to be identified only by his nickname, Kubik, interviewed last week while smoking beside a road in the town of Siversk, a staging area to the west of the fighting. He had recently rotated away from positions near Sievierodonetsk.
“Let them come forward a little bit, let them think they have captured the town, and then we will meet them beautifully” from the more advantageous position, he said.
The city lies on the mostly flat, eastern bank of the Seversky Donets. The western bank, in contrast, rises in a prominent hill that provides commanding views and firing positions.
Earlier in the war, Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded in Mariupol and fought for weeks, eventually retreating to hold just a tiny pocket of ground in a steel factory complex where they sheltered in bunkers, before Mr. Zelensky ordered the holdouts to surrender rather than be killed.
Ukrainian commanders decided to avert a smaller-scale version of that siege earlier this week in Sviatohirsk, a town lying on the low bank of the Seversky Donets.
Trying to trap Ukrainian troops in the town, Russian forces had been firing artillery at their only remaining route across the river, a bridge near an Orthodox monastery that was also frequently hit. On Monday, the Ukrainian army pulled back, blew up the bridge and took up positions on the river’s high bank, Ukrainian officials said.
Sievierodonetsk was once a sleepy, provincial backwater of about 100,000 residents, with streets lined with poplar trees and a skyline dominated by smokestacks of a fertilizer factory.
Now it is a largely abandoned ruin where battle lines sway often, with each side at times claiming to have expelled the other from part of the city. On Tuesday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian military governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces were again storming positions. “Combat continues,” he said.
Russian artillery fire into the potential fallback position on the high bank, where Lysychansk lies, has also been ferocious. Shelling hit a market, a mining academy and a school, Mr. Haidai said. The strike on the market touched off a fire that burned through the day Monday. Two civilians were wounded.
The Ukrainian government has been emphasizing the tenuousness of its positions in the battle for Donbas, the mining and farming region now mostly controlled by Russian forces.
The pivotal access bridge to Sievierodonetsk is a panorama of destruction, testifying to the difficulty and risk to Ukraine in holding even some portion of the city.
A video recorded by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporters who entered on a resupply run last week showed the mayhem on the span: crossing it meant weaving between the burned husks of cars and shell craters in the bridge deck.
The debris has piled up over the past two weeks. In an interview in late May, a soldier at a sandbagged checkpoint at the western edge of the bridge cautioned that Russian artillery spotters had the span — clear of debris at the time — under observation and opened fire whenever a car drove over. Two other bridges into the city were destroyed earlier in May.
Mr. Haidai has justified Ukraine’s efforts to hold Sievierodonetsk as partly a matter of symbolic resistance.
“Strategically, the city of Sievierodonetsk is not of great importance,” he said over the weekend. The high opposite riverbank is more significant militarily, he said. “But politically, Sievierodonetsk is a regional center. Its liberation will lift our morale substantially and demoralize the Russians.”
Still, Mr. Zelensky said he was open to reconsidering his decision based on developments. Either command — to hold ground or to retreat — had potential downsides, he said.
“In the first option there is risk, in the second option there is risk,” he said.
