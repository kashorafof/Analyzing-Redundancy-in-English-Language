It’s easy to feel powerless against climate change. But the way to beat climate anxiety is through meaningful actions that empower you — at home and beyond.
Here are five ways to do that →
Protect your home. Peace of mind comes with being prepared, so think hard about the dangers your house may pose. Climate change means not just more fire, floods, heat and drought, but also more mold, pollen and ticks.
Come up with one-year, three-year and five-year climate plans for your home. Clear brush and trees, buy sump pumps and flood barriers, fire-proof any decks and insulate windows.
Protect yourself against wildfire.
Protect your trees. Wildfires are more widespread than ever, fueled by branches, dead trees and overcrowded forests. If you live in a wooded area, see if there’s a local brush-clearing group nearby. Bring your own chainsaw. 
Join Team Rubicon.
Protect your coastline. Healthy barrier wetlands can defend against rising storm surge. Most shoreline communities have volunteer programs where you can pull weeds or plant native marsh flora.
Check out a wetland monitoring program.
Respond to disaster. After any climate-related event there is a need for an immediate response, as well as a longterm one. 
Find out what your community will need after fires and floods. Train to volunteer with the Red Cross, or help someone rebuild their home. 
Volunteer with the Red Cross.
Pitch in with Habitat for Humanity.
Capture carbon. Plants are currently the only surefire way to pull carbon out of our air. That means putting aside land and managing it well. Land trusts try to do just that and often need help with projects or funds to buy more land.
