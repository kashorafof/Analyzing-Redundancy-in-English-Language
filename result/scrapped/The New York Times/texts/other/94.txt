For nearly all my life, women in the United States have had the legal right to abortion. But of course, in the coming days, it’s all but guaranteed that right will go away, when Roe v. Wade is overturned. No matter where you land on the issue, it is a seismic change. And it’s deepening the fractures that have defined this latest chapter of American life. While everyone is shouting at each other, more nuanced stories are getting drowned out. Behind every pregnancy and every abortion is a different woman’s story, a different journey that led her to the moment where she was having a baby, or she wasn’t. And so, for me, I keep thinking about what it means to make a choice, to have a choice, or not to.
Choice is at the heart of Merritt Tierce’s story. She was raised in rural Texas in a conservative religious household. And as she neared the end of college, she was planning a future that would take her to Yale Divinity School and a life far beyond her roots. But then everything changed. I’m Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and this is “First Person.” Today, Merritt Tierce and the abortion she didn’t have.
All right, here we go. Merritt, your senior year of college, you gave a presentation on abortion. Can you take me back a couple of decades into that room with you? Who was that girl? What does she believe at that moment, what is she telling the class?
Who was that girl? I uh — that girl — so she was 19 years old. She was a Christian. And she was very smart. And I had been raised to believe that the Bible said that abortion was wrong and that it was this terrible sin. And so, this spring semester of 1999, I was about to finish college with a bachelor’s degree in English literature. And I was taking this communications seminar, so I had to give a speech. And I decided that my speech would be about how the Bible forbade abortion. So I talked about that. I talked about how abortion was a Holocaust. And I talked about how it was never OK. And I even handed out these little cards I had made to the other students. And there was a picture of a mangled fetus on one side of the card. And the great irony of this scene is that I was pregnant with my son at the time. I didn’t know it yet, but I had gotten pregnant without intending to. And obviously, I was talking about how I didn’t think abortion was ever the right choice. But within a few weeks, I was about to find myself in the situation where many people consider abortion. But that girl was not there yet. She was still really invested in the idea of herself as only a righteous Christian and only a high achieving student.
How did you find yourself pregnant, if you don’t mind my asking?
That’s the heart of the story, in a lot of ways. How did I find myself pregnant?
Um, I had sex. So I —
I figured.
Yes, I wasn’t really dating my kid’s dad. He was a good friend, and I really liked him. He was a wonderful person. And I felt very safe with him. We had a good friendship. But I didn’t really want to date him. In fact, I was interested in one of his friends romantically. But I didn’t have any intention of exploring my sexuality or of wanting a sexual relationship with either of them because I thought it was wrong. I thought I wasn’t supposed to have sex until I was married.
But I also had all of these normal human sexual desires, or at least, a lot of sexual energy that I didn’t know what to do with and I didn’t understand. So there was this split where my son’s father and I kept finding ourselves in moments of physical affection that led to sex and really trying to resist it and failing over and over. So that’s why we didn’t use any contraception. If I had taken the birth control pill — which I never even considered because that would have been me saying to myself I intend to sin, and I couldn’t do that. It was — yeah.
And as you said, this moment when you’re standing in front of your class, this was a few weeks before you would learn that you were pregnant. How did you find out? I mean, how long is it after you’ve delivered this presentation on abortion to your class that you discover that, actually, what you’d been doing had resulted in you actually getting pregnant?
It was shortly after that presentation. That would have been in late March or April of 1999. And around the time I graduated at the beginning of May, I realized that I hadn’t started my period. And I waited a couple of weeks. And one of my professors was teaching this class. It was part of the summer session, called Women’s Spirituality. And I had just graduated. And I was headed to Yale. And I was really interested in literature. And so she asked me to guest teach a day on literature as part of her Women’s Spirituality class.
And it was during the break that day that I had a pregnancy test with me. And I went down the hall to the restroom. And I was in the Bible building, the biblical studies building. And I took the pregnancy test there. And I remember that moment so clearly. It’s like — I’m feeling a lot of emotion right now because I remember it so clearly.
It’s OK.
I realized instantaneously when I saw the two pink lines appear telling me that I was pregnant, there was no way to go back to before that moment and that I was going to have to make a choice that was going to be impossible. I understood all of this immediately that either I would have to have a baby that I wasn’t ready to have, or I would have to have an abortion. And I believed that would be just the most wrong thing.
I also realized that it made me suddenly feel like my dream of going to Yale and doing something so far beyond what I knew that I had thought — you know, I had thought how is this possible that I could do something this exciting? And now it seemed like the reality of that was, oh, you can’t. It’s not for you. So all of these very heavy realizations just landed on me in this bathroom stall at the Bible building. And then I went back to this class and started talking about literature. And —
You went back to class? Do you remember what it was that you were teaching in that class?
Yeah, I was teaching from this book called “Cries of the Spirit.” It’s an anthology of poems of women writing about the experience of being a woman. And at the time, it was just very new to me that the words of a woman could matter because that wasn’t really the culture I was raised in. It was very focused on how important men are and that men are the authority.
And what was interesting about that book was that when I read it now, it seems like a coded text because it contained all of this writing about the thing that I was actually experiencing in that moment, but I didn’t really understand it.
Can you give me an example of what looks to you now like coded text? I mean, something that you were talking about specifically that day.
Yeah, there’s a poem by Mary Oliver that’s really beautiful that’s in that collection that was one that I was teaching from. And this poem in particular, she says, “One day, you finally knew what you had to do and began, though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice.” And at the time, I think I was immersed in a culture of voices shouting bad advice. But I didn’t know it. I believed the advice at the time.
Yeah, tell me more about that advice. I mean, what was the advice that you were getting from the people in your life? The man you were sleeping with, your parents.
I think my kid’s father was as shocked as I was. We were both just completely out of our depth. And my parents were, I think, terrified because it wasn’t what anyone expected of me. It was a completely unexpected turn of events that I would be a, quote unquote, “fallen woman.” And I think there was a lot of shame as well that manifested as fear. And I think the way they saw the way out of it was for me to marry my kid’s father and that that would make the pregnancy OK.
And so, there was never a conversation about abortion or about whether or not I wanted to have a baby. I think everyone assumed that I was going to have a baby because I was pregnant. And it’s like, I never chose. It just, at some point in there, it became more likely that I was having a baby. I just didn’t feel like I was in control of anything.
So it sounds like ultimately, though, the pregnancy, the wedding, it all moves forward, right?
Yeah.
Can you tell me about the wedding day?
So everything happened so fast, I mean, kind of shockingly fast, because I got pregnant at some point in April, and then I was getting married in July. And the day of the wedding, I felt extremely dissociated. I was also sick, and so I was really focused on not throwing up during the wedding, not from nerves, but from morning sickness.
And it was very hot. It was July in Texas. I got married in a rose garden. So I remember being driven to the ceremony and not wanting to get out of the car and feeling very young, feeling almost like a toddler. Like, I do not want to get out of this car and get married. And I had to.
Are there pictures from that day?
Yeah, yeah, and I look happy. Frankly, I looked great because I had lost 20 pounds from morning sickness.
It’s beautiful. Everyone looks happy. It looks like a wedding. I’m wearing a white dress. It looks like a fantasy, in some way. And I’m smiling a lot.
Can you see anything in your eyes, though, or not?
No, I just know. I remember. I remember what was happening inside me. And I remember feeling really scared, like I just had to keep going and doing the performance of what was expected of me.
Yeah, I think there are so many cultural, societal expectations that tell us, especially as women, that there are sort of two days that should be the happiest of our lives, you know, our wedding day. And then there’s the other day when we bring a child into the world. I mean, what was that day like when your son, you know, came out and was put into your arms?
I was — like I said, I was kind of in a state of shock about everything from the beginning, from the moment I took that pregnancy test. And so it also seemed abstract to me that the baby would come out of me, even though I had done everything I could think of to do to prepare for the birth because I was still an overachiever, and I had read “What to Expect When You’re Expecting.” And I had —
Done the research.
Done the research, and I was trying to be a good mom inside this experience I felt like I hadn’t chosen. And so, it was really painful, as childbirth is. And I don’t think we talk about that enough. But I just remember having — you know, descending into this animal state and feeling like I’m dying. And there’s no way out of here, except for my body to rip open. And so when I did push my son out, I just collapsed.
I mean, what I remember is a nurse put a warmed, heavy blanket on top of me. And I had this moment of really intense pleasure because I realized, oh, I can’t do anything more. It doesn’t matter. I can’t lift my arms, can’t move my head. And I just passed out.
That felt good to you, that sort of loss of control. Like, you had to just give up everything and just be able to kind of release it all?
Yeah, it felt like, I’m just off the hook now because it doesn’t matter if anyone asks anything else of me. I can’t give anyone anything.
I’m wondering, though, what that first interaction when you saw your son was. How did you experience that moment?
Oh, of course, I thought he was so beautiful and so innocent. And a new person is such a — it’s the most ordinary thing, and it’s also the most supernatural, magical thing.
And terrifying.
And terrifying, yes. And so, yeah, there was this moment. When we finally left the hospital, my son’s father and I and my dad all got in the elevator to go down. And we were staring at my son. And no one pushed the button in the elevator. So we just stood there for five minutes, waiting for the elevator to move and forgetting, you know? Which is, that’s the moment that everyone will recognize is like, yeah, it is so cool when a new person comes along. So there was that.
But then there was also this other thing that was like, I just felt like I’m not ready for this. I don’t know why anyone is giving me a baby. I don’t know what to do with a baby. And I felt a lot of these feelings on behalf of my son because I felt like, oh, obviously, you deserve the best parent. And it’s not me.
There’s joy, but there’s a lot of grief, it sounds like.
Yeah. Yeah, they were both very strong. And I think the myth is that somehow, the joy is supposed to just wash away the grief. But that wasn’t my experience.
[MUSIC]
So you’re in this elevator to go home. And at some point, you do push the button. And you’ve got this whole new reality that you have to face. You’re 19 — you’re 20 at this point?
Yeah, I was 20 by then.
Yeah, you’ve got a newborn. You’re newly married. What is this new life that you walked into?
We lived in a small town in North Texas, after I got pregnant and we got married. I mean, I had graduated from college. But I was the mother of a newborn. And my kid’s dad was — he was still in college when our son was born. And —
You’re saying kids plural.
Yeah, so when my son was seven months old, I got pregnant again. So I had two children who were, you know, about a year apart. And so we were just kind of trying to support ourselves. And I don’t know how we did. I mean, we had no money.
And I stayed home with the kids, with two babies. And, you know, I just did that.
I want to just pause for a moment because there was so much trauma around this first pregnancy. I’m just wondering how you found yourself pregnant again seven months later. Was that a choice that you made?
It was, actually. And I think with my daughter, what I was trying to do was to get some control back. And so, I did get pregnant with her on purpose. And subconsciously, I really wanted to overwrite that experience. I wanted to redo it. And I really didn’t understand this was what I was doing at the time. But I felt like I was giving myself that gift of, yeah, this is how you want to feel about your pregnancy.
And I actually pulled her out of my body myself. And so it was the exact opposite of my experience with my first pregnancy, in many ways, even though I still felt like I was living a life I hadn’t planned to live. And I also, at the same time, felt this undercurrent of, but when do I get back to what I wanted for myself and what I recognize as my true self?
I’m thinking about that photograph from your wedding, where no one could have told that you weren’t happy. Do you think that’s true of this period, too? I mean, from the outside, even to your children, do you think you looked and felt like a happy wife and mother?
Yeah, in public, I think, sometimes, often, probably. I think at home, it was different. And the people who would have seen that the most were my husband and my kids. I think I was really —
I was just so immature.
And how was your relationship with your husband?
It was tough. I mean, we never really got past the part at the very beginning of our relationship where I didn’t want to be a wife. And I’d never felt like I fully chose him as my partner. I think there were moments in our four years together when we thought, maybe I would be able to just manually convert myself into a person who wanted this life, but I never could. And so I feel like things were really stacked against us. And —
You say you were only together for four years. How did you ultimately come apart?
I was just — I was really unhappy. Part of that was I started having an affair with someone I worked with at a restaurant, and I got pregnant. And I didn’t know who the father was. I didn’t know if the father was my kids’ dad or this other person. And I don’t know if that would have made a difference because it seemed important not to have another child I couldn’t give enough to. I felt like if I have another child, these two children that I already feel like I can’t give them enough, I’ll be able to give them even less, and that it just wouldn’t be fair to them.
So I decided to have an abortion.
And I did have an abortion.
So obviously, at that point in my life, I was able to choose abortion. But that was because at that point in my life, I also was no longer religious.
When my daughter was a baby, we were going to this church that didn’t allow women to speak to the assembled congregation, didn’t allow women to teach children if they were older than a certain age. And when my daughter was very small, I realized I couldn’t bear for her to grow up in that community. I just couldn’t stand for her to think that she was inferior. And as soon as I had that realization, I realized, it would be equally damaging to let my son grow up there, thinking that he was inherently superior. And I just immediately quit.
But it was very recent at the time that I had the abortion. And so I felt like I could do it. But that architecture was still inside me. I mean, that’s how my brain was built and how my heart was built. And so, I still felt definitely haunted. And yeah, I just felt the weight of it.
But I also felt like I understood why I was doing it. And I supported my reasons for doing it.
So what happened next?
So then we got divorced. And then I kept waiting tables. And I was very self-destructive. And the culture of this one restaurant that I worked in was so misogynistic and so dark, in a lot of ways. And I really embodied that literally. Like, I burned myself and cut myself. And I did all of these things that are kind of classic manifestations of internalized self-hatred, which I definitely felt. I just mostly felt ashamed of myself throughout my 20s without really understanding it. I just — yeah.
Is there a moment in your mind that feels like the low point or the turning point?
Ugh. So many low points.
A turning point then, maybe.
Yeah, I think as much as that culture was tough, this restaurant that I worked in, I was observing this whole world that I was part of every night. And I was taking all of that in. And somewhere in there, I wrote a story about it, which is called “Suck It.” It kind of gave me the whole next chapter of my life that I’m still living. I mean, it’s hard to believe how much that one story gave me.
But I think it’s because all of this darkness and energy went into it. And I think I was really trying to get a handle on why every direction I looked and a lot of the experiences I had had as a woman were so damaging. And after I wrote that story, there was a moment when it seemed like, oh, maybe I could reroute my life toward this. But I didn’t really understand how to do that, except to go to grad school. So I did eventually go back to grad school.
Where?
At Iowa, the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.
Hey, let us know — the Yale of writing programs.
Yes.
You found your way back.
It is. It’s very competitive. It’s thought of by many people as the most prestigious writing program. And so I did find my way back, in a sense. And it felt like, OK, I’m making a concrete step back toward the self that I recognize as my self and what I want for life. And I think that was good for my kids because it was good for me.
It sounds like you’re saying that you felt more completely like a mother once there was something else there to sustain you, too, in your story.
Yeah, exactly. I felt more completely like a person I wanted to be. And that let me feel like I knew how to give something more to my kids.
I want to flash forward now almost 15 years to this past year. Your children are, obviously, in their 20s at this moment. And a few months ago, you published an essay in “The New York Times Magazine” that brought together this story of your life that you’ve been sharing with us with your life now as a writer. And it was called “The Abortion I Didn’t Have.” And it landed with a lot of force. And I think maybe there are a couple of reasons for that. You know, one is the backdrop in this country right now.
And the second, I think, is that you were saying something that we don’t often hear women say in public, which is that you were not OK with the fact that you had a child that you felt that you had not had a choice. You said, of course, that you love your son, but that you feel he deserved a different mom, one who had chosen to have him. And I wonder why you felt the need to put that out into the world at that moment.
Yeah, I mean, I think it’s taken me a very long time. It’s taken me 20 years to understand what happened to me and why it was so painful, and especially as my kids got to be the age that I was when I got pregnant with my son. And I’m looking at them. I just felt so deeply how young they are and how young I was. And I mean, it took me a year to write this essay because I felt like there was some sort of psychological force field around these ideas. And it was very hard to get to them.
I mean, I just spent a lot of time on my floor, crying, because I felt like — I kept going back and forth feeling like —
trusting myself and believing what I had written and then also feeling completely crazy, like it would be the worst thing to say. That it would make no sense, as someone who loves my son, as his mother, to say these things. That it was all the stuff I was not ever supposed to say, and there was no reason to say it. And so, it was very hard for me to get to the place where it felt like maybe it was worth doing.
And that was very much a direct result, I think, of what’s happening right now. I just felt like we just need new stories. And we need more honesty. And we need more freedom to talk about how difficult it is to be a parent. And I feel like that is at the heart of what we’re talking about when we talk about abortion. But that’s not the way we talk about it.
So I think that has been part of my grief, too, is realizing, yeah, I just wasn’t ready. It’s true. And I wish I could have had, for myself, this other experience of parenting, where I was ready. Especially knowing my kids and how amazing each of them is, I wish I had been able to give those people the parent I could be now.
Merritt, I want to come back to that Mary Oliver poem that you talked about sharing with your class that day, that you learned that you were pregnant more than, yeah, 20 years ago. Looking back now at that girl teaching this to her class just moments after she’s learned that she’s pregnant, feeling, I guess, at that point, that you had no choice, what would you say to her?
You know, there’s not a lot I could say to her. There’s nothing I could say to her that would change the situation. I guess, all I can offer her is the honesty of telling her, yeah, it’s going to be hard. You’re not ready to have a baby. And you’re going to. And it’s going to be as hard and painful as you’re afraid it will be. And you won’t really meet the challenge. There’s no easy way to make this better.
But I would have wanted her to know that paying attention to this voice that is coming through the Mary Oliver poem is going to save you, in some way, much later on. But I also don’t really believe in that.
I don’t believe in saying to anyone, you’ll figure it out. It’s all going to be fine, which kind of sounds like what I’m saying I would say to her. I don’t believe in that. But I think that all I could really offer her is to continue to hold on to whatever it was she was paying attention to in that poem.
You know, we’ve been talking about this poem. Would you mind reading it to me?
Yeah, sure, I can do that. Let me — one second.
OK, “The Journey” by Mary Oliver.
“One day, you finally knew what you had to do and began, though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice, though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. Mend my life, each voice cried. But you didn’t stop. You knew what you had to do, though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible.
It was already late enough and a wild night in the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voice behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds. And there was a new voice, which you slowly recognized as your own, that kept you company, as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life that you could save.”
Merritt, thank you so much for talking to me.
Thank you.

For nearly all my life, women in the United States have had the legal right to abortion. But of course, in the coming days, it’s all but guaranteed that right will go away, when Roe v.

Behind every pregnancy and every abortion is a different woman’s story, a different journey that led her to the moment where she was having a baby, or she wasn’t. And so, for me, I keep thinking about what it means to make a choice, to have a choice, or not to.
Choice is at the heart of Merritt Tierce’s story. She was raised in rural Texas in a conservative religious household. And as she neared the end of college, she was planning a future that would take her to Yale Divinity School and a life far beyond her roots. But then everything changed. I’m Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and this is “First Person.” Today, Merritt Tierce and the abortion she didn’t have.
All right, here we go. Merritt, your senior year of college, you gave a presentation on abortion. Can you take me back a couple of decades into that room with you? Who was that girl? What does she believe at that moment, what is she telling the class?
Who was that girl? I uh — that girl — so she was 19 years old. She was a Christian. And she was very smart.

And I decided that my speech would be about how the Bible forbade abortion. So I talked about that. I talked about how abortion was a Holocaust. And I talked about how it was never OK. And I even handed out these little cards I had made to the other students. And there was a picture of a mangled fetus on one side of the card. And the great irony of this scene is that I was pregnant with my son at the time. I didn’t know it yet, but I had gotten pregnant without intending to. And obviously, I was talking about how I didn’t think abortion was ever the right choice. But within a few weeks, I was about to find myself in the situation where many people consider abortion.

How did you find yourself pregnant, if you don’t mind my asking?
That’s the heart of the story, in a lot of ways. How did I find myself pregnant?
Um, I had sex. So I —
I figured.
Yes, I wasn’t really dating my kid’s dad. He was a good friend, and I really liked him. He was a wonderful person. And I felt very safe with him. We had a good friendship. But I didn’t really want to date him. In fact, I was interested in one of his friends romantically.

It was a completely unexpected turn of events that I would be a, quote unquote, “fallen woman.” And I think there was a lot of shame as well that manifested as fear. And I think the way they saw the way out of it was for me to marry my kid’s father and that that would make the pregnancy OK.
And so, there was never a conversation about abortion or about whether or not I wanted to have a baby. I think everyone assumed that I was going to have a baby because I was pregnant. And it’s like, I never chose. It just, at some point in there, it became more likely that I was having a baby. I just didn’t feel like I was in control of anything.
So it sounds like ultimately, though, the pregnancy, the wedding, it all moves forward, right?
Yeah.
Can you tell me about the wedding day?
So everything happened so fast, I mean, kind of shockingly fast, because I got pregnant at some point in April, and then I was getting married in July. And the day of the wedding, I felt extremely dissociated. I was also sick, and so I was really focused on not throwing up during the wedding, not from nerves, but from morning sickness.
And it was very hot. It was July in Texas. I got married in a rose garden. So I remember being driven to the ceremony and not wanting to get out of the car and feeling very young, feeling almost like a toddler. Like, I do not want to get out of this car and get married. And I had to.
Are there pictures from that day?
Yeah, yeah, and I look happy. Frankly, I looked great because I had lost 20 pounds from morning sickness.
It’s beautiful. Everyone looks happy. It looks like a wedding. I’m wearing a white dress. It looks like a fantasy, in some way. And I’m smiling a lot.
Can you see anything in your eyes, though, or not?
No, I just know. I remember. I remember what was happening inside me. And I remember feeling really scared, like I just had to keep going and doing the performance of what was expected of me.
Yeah, I think there are so many cultural, societal expectations that tell us, especially as women, that there are sort of two days that should be the happiest of our lives, you know, our wedding day. And then there’s the other day when we bring a child into the world. I mean, what was that day like when your son, you know, came out and was put into your arms?
I was — like I said, I was kind of in a state of shock about everything from the beginning, from the moment I took that pregnancy test. And so it also seemed abstract to me that the baby would come out of me, even though I had done everything I could think of to do to prepare for the birth because I was still an overachiever, and I had read “What to Expect When You’re Expecting.” And I had —
Done the research.
Done the research, and I was trying to be a good mom inside this experience I felt like I hadn’t chosen. And so, it was really painful, as childbirth is. And I don’t think we talk about that enough. But I just remember having — you know, descending into this animal state and feeling like I’m dying. And there’s no way out of here, except for my body to rip open. And so when I did push my son out, I just collapsed.
I mean, what I remember is a nurse put a warmed, heavy blanket on top of me. And I had this moment of really intense pleasure because I realized, oh, I can’t do anything more. It doesn’t matter. I can’t lift my arms, can’t move my head. And I just passed out.
That felt good to you, that sort of loss of control. Like, you had to just give up everything and just be able to kind of release it all?
Yeah, it felt like, I’m just off the hook now because it doesn’t matter if anyone asks anything else of me. I can’t give anyone anything.
I’m wondering, though, what that first interaction when you saw your son was. How did you experience that moment?
Oh, of course, I thought he was so beautiful and so innocent. And a new person is such a — it’s the most ordinary thing, and it’s also the most supernatural, magical thing.
And terrifying.
And terrifying, yes. And so, yeah, there was this moment. When we finally left the hospital, my son’s father and I and my dad all got in the elevator to go down. And we were staring at my son. And no one pushed the button in the elevator. So we just stood there for five minutes, waiting for the elevator to move and forgetting, you know? Which is, that’s the moment that everyone will recognize is like, yeah, it is so cool when a new person comes along. So there was that.
But then there was also this other thing that was like, I just felt like I’m not ready for this. I don’t know why anyone is giving me a baby. I don’t know what to do with a baby. And I felt a lot of these feelings on behalf of my son because I felt like, oh, obviously, you deserve the best parent. And it’s not me.
There’s joy, but there’s a lot of grief, it sounds like.
Yeah. Yeah, they were both very strong. And I think the myth is that somehow, the joy is supposed to just wash away the grief. But that wasn’t my experience.
[MUSIC]
So you’re in this elevator to go home. And at some point, you do push the button. And you’ve got this whole new reality that you have to face. You’re 19 — you’re 20 at this point?
Yeah, I was 20 by then.
Yeah, you’ve got a newborn. You’re newly married. What is this new life that you walked into?
We lived in a small town in North Texas, after I got pregnant and we got married. I mean, I had graduated from college. But I was the mother of a newborn. And my kid’s dad was — he was still in college when our son was born. And —
You’re saying kids plural.
Yeah, so when my son was seven months old, I got pregnant again. So I had two children who were, you know, about a year apart. And so we were just kind of trying to support ourselves. And I don’t know how we did. I mean, we had no money.
And I stayed home with the kids, with two babies. And, you know, I just did that.
I want to just pause for a moment because there was so much trauma around this first pregnancy. I’m just wondering how you found yourself pregnant again seven months later. Was that a choice that you made?
It was, actually. And I think with my daughter, what I was trying to do was to get some control back. And so, I did get pregnant with her on purpose. And subconsciously, I really wanted to overwrite that experience. I wanted to redo it. And I really didn’t understand this was what I was doing at the time. But I felt like I was giving myself that gift of, yeah, this is how you want to feel about your pregnancy.
And I actually pulled her out of my body myself. And so it was the exact opposite of my experience with my first pregnancy, in many ways, even though I still felt like I was living a life I hadn’t planned to live. And I also, at the same time, felt this undercurrent of, but when do I get back to what I wanted for myself and what I recognize as my true self?
I’m thinking about that photograph from your wedding, where no one could have told that you weren’t happy. Do you think that’s true of this period, too? I mean, from the outside, even to your children, do you think you looked and felt like a happy wife and mother?
Yeah, in public, I think, sometimes, often, probably. I think at home, it was different. And the people who would have seen that the most were my husband and my kids. I think I was really —
I was just so immature.
And how was your relationship with your husband?
It was tough. I mean, we never really got past the part at the very beginning of our relationship where I didn’t want to be a wife. And I’d never felt like I fully chose him as my partner. I think there were moments in our four years together when we thought, maybe I would be able to just manually convert myself into a person who wanted this life, but I never could. And so I feel like things were really stacked against us. And —
You say you were only together for four years. How did you ultimately come apart?
I was just — I was really unhappy. Part of that was I started having an affair with someone I worked with at a restaurant, and I got pregnant. And I didn’t know who the father was. I didn’t know if the father was my kids’ dad or this other person. And I don’t know if that would have made a difference because it seemed important not to have another child I couldn’t give enough to. I felt like if I have another child, these two children that I already feel like I can’t give them enough, I’ll be able to give them even less, and that it just wouldn’t be fair to them.
So I decided to have an abortion.
And I did have an abortion.
So obviously, at that point in my life, I was able to choose abortion. But that was because at that point in my life, I also was no longer religious.
When my daughter was a baby, we were going to this church that didn’t allow women to speak to the assembled congregation, didn’t allow women to teach children if they were older than a certain age. And when my daughter was very small, I realized I couldn’t bear for her to grow up in that community. I just couldn’t stand for her to think that she was inferior. And as soon as I had that realization, I realized, it would be equally damaging to let my son grow up there, thinking that he was inherently superior. And I just immediately quit.
But it was very recent at the time that I had the abortion. And so I felt like I could do it. But that architecture was still inside me. I mean, that’s how my brain was built and how my heart was built. And so, I still felt definitely haunted. And yeah, I just felt the weight of it.
But I also felt like I understood why I was doing it. And I supported my reasons for doing it.
So what happened next?
So then we got divorced. And then I kept waiting tables. And I was very self-destructive. And the culture of this one restaurant that I worked in was so misogynistic and so dark, in a lot of ways. And I really embodied that literally. Like, I burned myself and cut myself. And I did all of these things that are kind of classic manifestations of internalized self-hatred, which I definitely felt. I just mostly felt ashamed of myself throughout my 20s without really understanding it. I just — yeah.
Is there a moment in your mind that feels like the low point or the turning point?
Ugh. So many low points.
A turning point then, maybe.
Yeah, I think as much as that culture was tough, this restaurant that I worked in, I was observing this whole world that I was part of every night. And I was taking all of that in. And somewhere in there, I wrote a story about it, which is called “Suck It.” It kind of gave me the whole next chapter of my life that I’m still living. I mean, it’s hard to believe how much that one story gave me.
But I think it’s because all of this darkness and energy went into it. And I think I was really trying to get a handle on why every direction I looked and a lot of the experiences I had had as a woman were so damaging. And after I wrote that story, there was a moment when it seemed like, oh, maybe I could reroute my life toward this. But I didn’t really understand how to do that, except to go to grad school. So I did eventually go back to grad school.
Where?
At Iowa, the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.
Hey, let us know — the Yale of writing programs.
Yes.
You found your way back.
It is. It’s very competitive. It’s thought of by many people as the most prestigious writing program. And so I did find my way back, in a sense. And it felt like, OK, I’m making a concrete step back toward the self that I recognize as my self and what I want for life. And I think that was good for my kids because it was good for me.
It sounds like you’re saying that you felt more completely like a mother once there was something else there to sustain you, too, in your story.
Yeah, exactly. I felt more completely like a person I wanted to be. And that let me feel like I knew how to give something more to my kids.
I want to flash forward now almost 15 years to this past year. Your children are, obviously, in their 20s at this moment. And a few months ago, you published an essay in “The New York Times Magazine” that brought together this story of your life that you’ve been sharing with us with your life now as a writer. And it was called “The Abortion I Didn’t Have.” And it landed with a lot of force. And I think maybe there are a couple of reasons for that. You know, one is the backdrop in this country right now.
And the second, I think, is that you were saying something that we don’t often hear women say in public, which is that you were not OK with the fact that you had a child that you felt that you had not had a choice. You said, of course, that you love your son, but that you feel he deserved a different mom, one who had chosen to have him. And I wonder why you felt the need to put that out into the world at that moment.
Yeah, I mean, I think it’s taken me a very long time. It’s taken me 20 years to understand what happened to me and why it was so painful, and especially as my kids got to be the age that I was when I got pregnant with my son. And I’m looking at them. I just felt so deeply how young they are and how young I was. And I mean, it took me a year to write this essay because I felt like there was some sort of psychological force field around these ideas. And it was very hard to get to them.
I mean, I just spent a lot of time on my floor, crying, because I felt like — I kept going back and forth feeling like —
trusting myself and believing what I had written and then also feeling completely crazy, like it would be the worst thing to say. That it would make no sense, as someone who loves my son, as his mother, to say these things. That it was all the stuff I was not ever supposed to say, and there was no reason to say it. And so, it was very hard for me to get to the place where it felt like maybe it was worth doing.
And that was very much a direct result, I think, of what’s happening right now. I just felt like we just need new stories. And we need more honesty. And we need more freedom to talk about how difficult it is to be a parent. And I feel like that is at the heart of what we’re talking about when we talk about abortion. But that’s not the way we talk about it.
So I think that has been part of my grief, too, is realizing, yeah, I just wasn’t ready. It’s true. And I wish I could have had, for myself, this other experience of parenting, where I was ready. Especially knowing my kids and how amazing each of them is, I wish I had been able to give those people the parent I could be now.
Merritt, I want to come back to that Mary Oliver poem that you talked about sharing with your class that day, that you learned that you were pregnant more than, yeah, 20 years ago. Looking back now at that girl teaching this to her class just moments after she’s learned that she’s pregnant, feeling, I guess, at that point, that you had no choice, what would you say to her?
You know, there’s not a lot I could say to her. There’s nothing I could say to her that would change the situation. I guess, all I can offer her is the honesty of telling her, yeah, it’s going to be hard. You’re not ready to have a baby. And you’re going to. And it’s going to be as hard and painful as you’re afraid it will be. And you won’t really meet the challenge. There’s no easy way to make this better.
But I would have wanted her to know that paying attention to this voice that is coming through the Mary Oliver poem is going to save you, in some way, much later on. But I also don’t really believe in that.
I don’t believe in saying to anyone, you’ll figure it out. It’s all going to be fine, which kind of sounds like what I’m saying I would say to her. I don’t believe in that. But I think that all I could really offer her is to continue to hold on to whatever it was she was paying attention to in that poem.
You know, we’ve been talking about this poem. Would you mind reading it to me?
Yeah, sure, I can do that. Let me — one second.
OK, “The Journey” by Mary Oliver.
“One day, you finally knew what you had to do and began, though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice, though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. Mend my life, each voice cried. But you didn’t stop. You knew what you had to do, though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible.
It was already late enough and a wild night in the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voice behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds. And there was a new voice, which you slowly recognized as your own, that kept you company, as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life that you could save.”
Merritt, thank you so much for talking to me.
Thank you.

If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks, tens of millions of women will find themselves living in states where abortion is outlawed in almost all cases. And for some women, that will mean having children — without actually wanting them — because they are left with no choice.
[You can listen to this episode of “First Person” on Apple, Spotify or Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]
That’s where Merritt Tierce, a writer, was 23 years ago. At 19, she was not planning to become a mother when she found herself pregnant. “I realized instantaneously when I saw the two pink lines appear telling me that I was pregnant, there was no way to go back to before that moment,” she said. “I was going to have to make a choice that was going to be impossible.” This is the story of the abortion Merritt Tierce didn’t have.
Merritt wrote about her experience for The New York Times Magazine.
The collection of poems she mentions in the episode is called “Cries of the Spirit.”
