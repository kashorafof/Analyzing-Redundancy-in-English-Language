Pandemic-related supply chain issues, ingredient shortages and a major recall have meant that some formulas are out of stock in the United States. Some parents have resorted to alternative “solutions,” but they should be careful.
Here’s what not to do →
If you can’t find your baby’s formula, don’t make your own. Homemade formula is often nutritionally inadequate and can become contaminated with the bacteria that federal regulations try to protect against.
If you’re running low on formula, don’t dilute it or try to “stretch” it by adding water. This can cause electrolyte imbalances for your baby, and diluted formula is not nutritionally adequate.
Don’t buy formula from an online marketplace like Facebook or Craigslist. Some parents have been scammed or subjected to price gouging when trying to buy formula from a third party. Always go to a trusted store, pharmacy or directly to the manufacturer.
Don’t feed toddler formula to your infant. Toddler formula, for babies over 1 year old, is not regulated the same way infant formula is and doesn’t have the same nutritional content or manufacturing regulations. (Toddler formula may be OK for an older baby for a few days; check with your doctor.)
Buying imported European formulas, which aren’t FDA-approved, has potential risks. For example, in the United States, a hypoallergenic formula has only fully broken-down milk proteins. In Europe, a hypoallergenic formula may contain intact proteins, which can cause reactions in babies with allergies.
