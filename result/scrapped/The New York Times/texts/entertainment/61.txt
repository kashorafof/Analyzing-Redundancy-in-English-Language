I’m the assistant film editor on The Times’s Culture desk. Between screenings of “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Jurassic World: Dominion,” I like to fire up a good indie podcast or a thoughtful YouTube tutorial.
Here are five things I’ve been watching and listening to lately →
TV: ‘Upload’
Greg Daniels’s sci-fi comedy is about a future in which tech companies have created a digital afterlife. Now in its second season, it remains successful at taking existential ideas and grounding them in off-kilter humor.
Podcast: ‘Strong Songs’
Think you love music? Kirk Hamilton’s podcast will have you appreciating it in ways you didn’t know were possible. 
Hamilton takes one song and breaks down the essentials of what makes it shine. Listen to the episode about Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” and be blown away.
Film: ‘The Color Purple’ (1985)
I get teary-eyed just thinking about this movie. In Celie (Whoopi Goldberg), who crafted an extraordinary life despite the worst obstacles, I see my grandmothers, mother, aunt and sisters: all the heroic Black women who helped me become who I am.
YouTube: Nick Lewis
Lewis brings a fun personality and a sense of inventiveness to his videos about interior design hacks, which include low-hassle ways to put a decorative stamp on your apartment rental and tips on shopping at Ikea.
Album: ‘The Firewatcher’s Daughter’
This gift of an album by Brandi Carlile, from 2015, has been on my Spotify rotation constantly as of late. It’s rare that almost every song on a record tells its own heartfelt tale in its own style, but Carlile and her team of impeccable musicians pull it off here. And her voice of soaring highs and pensive lows is one I will follow most anywhere.
Here are some more recent favorites:
