I’m a photo editor on The Times’s Culture desk who focuses on film, music and comedy. I’m away from my desk this week, driving through the desert and sleeping next to some really big rocks.
Here are five cultural things I’ve been enjoying on and off the grid →
Book: ‘Who Is Changed and Who Is Dead’
A trove of imagery and text, Ahndraya Parlato’s second monograph is a deeply felt and complicated exploration of motherhood, death and gender.
It connects Ahndraya’s writing and photograms of her mother’s ashes with images of her own children and references to 19th-century “hidden mother” photography.
I return to this work frequently; its impact never dulls.
Music: Grateful Dead Cassettes
I’m gearing up for Dead & Company’s summer concerts with my collection of Grateful Dead live cassettes. What I love about these recordings, often made by people in the audience, is the noise of the crowds. It’s like I’m there with them.
TV: ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’
Reality TV is an art form all its own, and this diamond of the franchise is a master class in high-profile drama. Several complex conflicts — one involving a home invasion — are coming to a head this season.
A Pair of Photography Shows
Great photo shows in New York right now include Shikeith’s “grace comes violently” at Yossi Milo Gallery and Daniel Arnold’s “Nothing” at Larrie, which has my favorite photo ever taken of an N.Y.C. garbage truck.
Game: Framed
Part of my job is sifting through dozens of film stills looking for the most beautiful and informational images, so I have a leg up on the new trivia game where you guess the movie based on a series of frames. 
It has become part of my morning routine and wakes me up visually — once I’ve hit play on a Grateful Dead tape, made coffee and, of course, solved the day’s Wordle.
Try it yourself.
