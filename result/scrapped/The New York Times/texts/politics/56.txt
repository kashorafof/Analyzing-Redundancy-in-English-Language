The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol announced on Monday that it would reconvene on Tuesday for a hastily organized session to address what it described as a batch of recently obtained evidence. 
Before the announcement, the committee had not been expected to hold another hearing until next month, after the Houseâ€™s Fourth of July recess.
The newly added hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern time, and video of the session will be available at nytimes.com.
The committee did not provide any specifics about what the session would cover or which witnesses might be called.
Before the announcement on Monday, the committee had been expected to return with two additional hearings in July focused on the mob that attacked the Capitol and the stretch of time immediately after the breach of the building when Mr. Trump did not call off the attackers.
The committee plans to release its final report in September, before the midterm elections.
