	The leak in May of a draft of the decision overruling Roe v. Wade seemed to expose new fault lines at the Supreme Court in the first full term in which it has been dominated by a 6-to-3 conservative supermajority, including three justices appointed by President Donald J. Trump. The court’s public approval ratings have been dropping, and its new configuration has raised questions about whether it is out of step with public opinion.


	According to a recent survey from researchers at Harvard, Stanford and the University of Texas, the public is closely divided on how the court should rule in several major cases. In many of them, though, respondents held starkly different views based on their partisan affiliations. Here is a look at the major cases this term.

In 
            Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, the court ruled that a football coach at a public high school had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team’s games.

Question wording: The football coach at a public high school led prayers with players before and after games. The school district asked him to stop, and the coach refused. He was then suspended. Some people think the school district was right to suspend the coach because of the First Amendment’s separation of church and state. Other people do not think the district was right to do so because of the coach’s right to free exercise of religion. What do you think? | Source: SCOTUSPoll

Question wording: The defendant, a non-Native American, committed a crime against a Native American on Native American land.
