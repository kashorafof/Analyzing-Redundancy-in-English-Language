As a Harvard-trained lawyer for the Sonnenschein law firm in Chicago in the late 1950s, Donald G. Lubin did some low-level legal chores for McDonald’s, then a small hamburger chain.
A few years later, in 1964, Mr. Lubin got a call from June Martino, a bookkeeper and corporate secretary at McDonald’s. She wondered if he could provide legal information about weddings in Las Vegas, where a friend of hers was about to get married. He promptly called a county clerk in Nevada, got the answers and relayed them to Ms. Martino.
