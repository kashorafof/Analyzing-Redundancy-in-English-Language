San Francisco
As I walked to lunch last week in Little Saigon, a few blocks from City Hall, I hurried across Eddy Street to avoid an obvious group of drug dealers. The sidewalks were filthy, filled with homeless tents and a god-awful smell. Distracted, I almost tripped over a squatting man sticking a hypodermic needle between his toes. Two cops leaned against a police car nearby. Meanwhile, pedestrians lawfully waited at a traffic light before crossing. Why bother?
