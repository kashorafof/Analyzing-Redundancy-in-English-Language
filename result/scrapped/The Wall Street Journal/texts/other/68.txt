Senate Republicans recently introduced the Investor Democracy Is Expected Act, also styled the Index Act, which would require passive investment-fund managers that own more than 1% of a public company to collect instructions from their clients on how to vote their shares. The senators are right to focus on a major problem: The three largest passive asset managers control more than $20 trillion and vote nearly one-quarter of all shares cast at corporate annual meetings to support social agendas disfavored by many Americans whose money they manage. 
But as long as  BlackRock ,  Vanguard and State Street represent the largest shareholders of Americaâ€™s public companies, they will disproportionately influence the behavior of those companies, regardless of whether their clients regain the power to vote their shares.
