As a Cornell University student in the late 1960s, Bruce R. Katz had no interest in following his father and grandfather into the dying New England shoemaking business. He aimed to build a boat and sail around the world.
When he visited home, he found that imports had destroyed the familyâ€™s Hubbard Shoe Co. and that his father, Saul Katz, was trying to start over by importing moccasin-style shoes from Brazil. Bruce Katz agreed to help temporarily by loading up a converted van and selling the shoes wherever he could. He proved a persuasive shoe merchant and with his father formed Rockport Shoe Co. to design and sell shoes.
