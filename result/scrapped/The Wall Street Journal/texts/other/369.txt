WASHINGTON—U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland met with Ukraine’s top prosecutor at the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday in an unannounced visit to discuss efforts to investigate war crimes. 
In Krakovets, Ukraine, Mr. Garland said the U.S. Justice Department had created a War Crimes Accountability Team to provide operational assistance and advice to help Ukraine collect evidence and advance criminal prosecutions. Mr. Garland also said the team would be involved in continuing U.S. investigations into some war crimes that have a connection to the U.S., including the killing and wounding of American journalists covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
