OTTAWA—Annual inflation in Canada accelerated in May toward 8%, reaching a nearly four-decade high and all but locking in market expectations that the country’s central bank will raise its policy interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point in July.

The need for aggressive Bank of Canada rate increases to tame inflation has prompted analysts to predict a sharp slowdown in economic growth starting in the second half of this year, and to warn of heightened risks of a recession.
