Democrats on the House Jan. 6 committee are still hoping to discover a trail of bread crumbs leading to the Supreme Court, and specifically Justice Clarence Thomas, but they may be supremely disappointed. This week the committee leaked that it obtained correspondence between the Justice’s wife, Ginni Thomas, and John Eastman, the lawyer who advised President Trump after the 2020 election.
The horror, the horror. Then Mr. Eastman put out a statement. “I can categorically confirm that at no time did I discuss with Mrs. Thomas or Justice Thomas any matters pending or likely to come before the Court,” he said. “As for the email communications I had with Mrs. Thomas? As you can see for yourselves, she invited me to give an update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically.”
