You’re gonna hear her roar!
An Australian hostess was left stunned Saturday after she denied singer Katy Perry a table at a cafe in Port Douglas.
The “California Gurls” singer was in Australia with her partner, Orlando Bloom, 45, who is currently shooting a movie called “Wizards!,” according to the Daily Mail.
Perry, 37, had requested a table from the hostess, Indianna Paull, but was rebuffed when she was told there were none available, Paull revealed in a now-deleted TikTok.
“When you are the first dumb oblivious bitch to tell Katy Perry she has to wait for a table,” read the caption of the video.
Paull admitted on TikTok that she did not recognize Perry under the sunglasses and hat and told the pop star that she would have to wait.
While Perry initially argued with Paull over the lack of tables in the cafe, according to the hostess’s account, the singer later tipped her generously for treating her like a “normal person.”
“She [Perry] came in to get breakfast with her family, and we didn’t have a table available,” Paull wrote in the comments, according to Daily Mail.
The Post has reached out to Perry for comment. 
Paparazzi caught the whole exchange and subsequently published pictures of a disgruntled-looking Perry along with her 22-month-old daughter, Daisy, at the cafe entrance.
Paull detailed the exchange on TikTok, but has since taken the video down.
“POV: Katy Perry comes into your café and you don’t recognize her and argue over a table. Then she tips and hugs you for treating her like an everyday person,” she wrote.
Several commenters online agreed that making celebrities wait in line should not be a big deal. 
“Ok but hear me out celebrities SHOULD wait like the rest of us,” said one user. 
“Why shouldn’t she wait? She’s a normal person,” agreed another.
