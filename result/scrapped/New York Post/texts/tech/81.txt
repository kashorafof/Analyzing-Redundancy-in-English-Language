Jamie Erdahl is replacing Kay Adams as host of NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football,” The Post has learned. 
She will join Peter Schrager and Kyle Brandt on NFL Network’s flagship morning program. The show still has not announced a permanent replacement for analyst Nate Burleson, who left in 2021 to co-host “CBS This Morning.”
An NFL Media spokesperson declined to comment.
Erdahl has been a host and sideline reporter at CBS Sports since 2014.
Most recently, she has been a sideline reporter for the network’s SEC Game of the Week in football, and also worked the sidelines for the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. 
Adams left “Good Morning Football” this past May after having been the host of the program since its inception in 2016. 
There was a belief in industry circles that she could become the host of Amazon’s Prime Video coverage of “Thursday Night Football,” but that job ultimately went to Fox Sports host Charissa Thompson.
