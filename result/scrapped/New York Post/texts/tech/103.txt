This Dodgers fan had a little too much fun at the ballgame — at least too much for security’s liking. 
During Saturday’s Mets-Dodgers game at Dodger Stadium, stadium workers escorted a woman from her front row seats after she repeatedly revealed her breasts while dancing.
In a TikTok created by Mirza Lisbeth Pineda, the fan can be seen dancing in her backless outfit before later being approached by security.

“She was obviously drunk,” Pineda wrote. “She was living her dream as a Dodger cheerleader but her dress wasn’t ‘Micheladas-approved’ so her girl keeps popping out. 
“The lady is pretty so Karens start complaining, the staff asked her to leave many times. 
“She wasn’t bothering anybody and the guys were happy for the free show.” 
In an additional TikTok, five staff members are seen struggling to carry the pleading woman up the stairs, forcibly removing her from the stadium.

According to Pineda, the woman “didn’t have a ticket” for the front row seats that she claimed, and had been “jumping from seat to seat” instead.
