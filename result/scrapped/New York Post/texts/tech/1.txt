There are some tasks on your to-do list that are better to outsource (robot vacuums, anyone?). But unfortunately, there are some duties that you just have to do on your own… especially at work and school. If you want to be as productive as possible, it’s pretty tough to get things done without Microsoft Office.
If you’re been living without these computer staples, it’s time to welcome them back with open arms during the Deal Days sale — we’re offering this fleet of must-haves on sale for both Mac and Windows at the lowest price ever, $39.99, now through July 14th.
A lifetime license to Microsoft Office Professional 2021 gives you access to eight essential programs, like the old tried-and-trues: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Outlook. There’s also the go-to for anyone who has ever had to make a presentation, whether it be at work or school, Microsoft PowerPoint.
Getting things done at work has never been easier thanks to easy communication on Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft OneNote, Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Access round out this endlessly helpful bundle of programs. You’ll have permanent access to all of them, all you have to do is choose your preferred operating system, whether that be Windows or Mac, and wait for that instant delivery and download.
After you receive your download link, download the programs and then use the software license keys to get up and running. Not a tech whiz? No worries, Microsoft offers free customer service that can help you out with the products at any time.
Get Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for the lowest price ever, just $39.99 for Mac and Windows, during Deal Days. This makes each program just $5 each, and they can all be yours if you act before July 14th — no coupon needed!
