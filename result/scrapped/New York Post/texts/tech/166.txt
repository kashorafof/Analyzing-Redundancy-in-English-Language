Business-class passengers should expect warm nuts and pillow service — not this.
An American Airlines customer took to social media to complain about “small, live bugs” he allegedly found in a salad given to him as a recent in-flight meal, Jam Press reported.
The man, named Ricky James according to his Twitter bio, claimed that he paid $10,000 for his round-trip seat from Frankfurt, Germany, to Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas — but was disappointed with the “quality of service” in the air.
A video he tweeted shows small, black specks that seem to be crawling beneath the plastic wrap around a white plate. 
“@AmericanAir here is a video I took from my flight today from FRA to DFW … food with live bugs being served and a staff that simply laughed it off and asked if I wanted a different salad,” he tweeted on June 2.
James added that staff shouldn’t have had to ask if he’d like a new dish — and should have immediately brought him one instead.
The airline replied directly to James’ tweet hours later on Thursday. “Thanks for bringing this to our attention,” they wrote. “We’ll send this over to the right team to review this further.”
The Post reached out to American Airlines as well as Gate Gourmet, a Swiss international airline caterer that supplies ready-made meals to multiple airlines, for comment on the ordeal on Monday. 
“We’re concerned about this report, as what the customer is describing is not up to our standards,” American Airlines said in a statement. “We are investigating this matter and are working directly with our catering provider in Frankfurt. A member of our team has reached out to the customer to apologize and learn more about their experience.”
Gate Gourmet did not respond to a request for comment.
James had posted on Friday that he hadn’t yet heard back from American Airlines but asserted — without evidence — that it might be an “ongoing” issue for Gate Gourmet. 
Meanwhile, one follower suggested a possible solution to the dispute: “How about his $10K back?”
