A fourth suspect has been arrested in the slaying of a Staten Island bodybuilder during a home invasion late last year, cops said Monday. 
DeAndre McClellan, 24, of Summerville, NC, was extradited from Alabama to the Big Apple on Saturday and charged for his role in the December slaying of iron-pumping Tamer Shaarawy, 38, inside the victim’s Arden Heights home, authorities said.  
McClellan, who does not have any prior New York City arrests, was charged with murder, robbery, criminal possession of a machine gun and criminal possession of a loaded firearm, cops said. 
Back in February, Emanuel Sullivan, 20, was arrested for the murder, too, and hit with the same charges, police said. 
Sullivan died in custody on Rikers Island late last month. The jailed suspect was found unresponsive in his bed. An investigation is ongoing, authorities said.
Kaitlyn Reuter, 35, and Nathaniel Morton, 40, were also busted in connection to Shaarawy’s murder in late January. 
They were each charged with murder, two counts of robbery and four counts of criminal possession of a weapon, cops said.
Shaarawy was blasted in the shoulder when the suspects entered his home on Hinton Street near Woodrow Road around 1:30 a.m. Dec. 16, cops said. 
The suspects also snatched a chain off the victim’s neck, cops said. 
Shaarawy was rushed to Staten Island University South Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
