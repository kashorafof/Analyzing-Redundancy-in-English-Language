Tiger Woods is in the club with Nicklaus, Snead, and Palmer as one of the greatest golfers of all time. This week, he entered another exclusive group, joining Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only athlete billionaires.
Just days after turning down a rumored high-nine figure offer from the Saudi-backed LIV Tour, Tiger Woods hit the ten figure mark on his own, with the 46-year-old valued at $1.8 billion according to Forbes.
The golf legend has put together one of the greatest careers the PGA Tour has ever seen, racking up 82 career wins and 15 major victories. Despite his track record, Forbes reports less than 10% of Woods’ earnings have come from the golf course.
Woods has won $120 million from his various PGA tour wins, with the majority of his income coming from his numerous and illustrious endorsement deals.
Most notably, Gatorade, Bridgestone, and Nike have been longtime sponsors. Other big names paying Woods include TaylorMade and Monster Energy which are featured on his golf bag.
Woods has also grown his net worth through various business ventures off of the golf course. He has opened restaurants and golf courses, and most recently investing in PopStroke, a luxury mini golf company.
Even after numerous setbacks in his career, the tumultuous 2009 series of events, and his horrific Feb. 2021 car crash that was thought to be career-ending, Woods still has seen continuous growth in his net worth. He’s only made appearances in the Masters and the PGA championship in the past few months, but still made $68 million in off-course earnings during his recuperation. That’s enough to make him the 14th-highest paid athlete per Forbes.
