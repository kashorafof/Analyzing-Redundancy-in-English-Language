Two senators who voted to confirm Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch blasted them for helping to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion — asserting that they were misled.
Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said they felt betrayed after Gorsuch and Kavanaugh helped shore up the majority vote to eliminate Roe v. Wade, according to a report.
“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon,” Collins said in a statement.
Collins criticized the ruling as “a sudden and radical jolt to the country that will lead to political chaos, anger, and a further loss of confidence in our government.”
Manchin said he was “deeply disappointed” with the way the justices voted.
“I trusted Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh when they testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans,” Manchin said.
