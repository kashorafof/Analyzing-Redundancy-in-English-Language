An Indian boy is being described as “made of glass” due to a rare condition in which his bones break at the slightest touch. 
Rohit, 12, suffers from osteogenesis imperfectas, more commonly known as “brittle bone disease,” in which the bones break down faster than they can rebuild, causing them to become so fragile that a minor fall or other stresses can cause them to fracture, according to the Mayo Clinic. 
However, the Uttar Pradesh resident’s condition is so severe that his bones can shatter at the slightest touch, according to Jam Press.
Due to his porcelain-esque skeletal structure, the  boy has reportedly broken 100 bones during his lifetime and is in constant pain for most of the day. In addition, Rohit’s osteogenesis imperfectas has severely stunted his growth to the point that he stands 1-foot, 4-inches tall and weighs about 32 pounds. 
In order to prevent damage to his bones, Rohit is unable to play with friends and relies on his mother to move, according to Jam Press. Meanwhile, Rohit’s sister is teaching him to read, as he can’t attend school due to his condition. 
Despite his hardships, Rohit said he won’t let his illness prevent him from achieving his dream of becoming a singer. 
There is currently no cure for osteogenesis imperfectas, although sufferers can mitigate the symptoms by taking calcium supplements and medications that promote bone growth, according to Healthline.
Meanwhile, women are urged to avoid cosmetics with the chemical triclosan after a 2019 Chinese study found that the chemical could double their chances of developing osteogenesis imperfectas.
