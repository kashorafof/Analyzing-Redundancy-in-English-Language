Donald Trump, Ivanka and Don Jr. have filed a notice of appeal with New York’s highest court seeking to block an order forcing their testimony in New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into the Trump Organization.
The family trio earlier Wednesday signed an agreement with James’ office saying they would give their sworn testimony on July 15 — unless New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, first ruled in their favor that they don’t have to be deposed.
It is unclear whether the Court of Appeals will hear their case.
The appeal comes after two prior unsuccessful bids by the Trumps to block the AG’s subpoenas for their testimony — including by a lower appellate court that tossed their case last month.
James launched her probe of the family real estate company in 2019 following congressional testimony from Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen alleging that Trump had exaggerated company assets for loan, insurance and tax purposes.
In 2020, the AG filed suit claiming that the Trump Organization was stonewalling her investigation.
The former president faced a civil contempt order from the judge in the case for not meeting a March 31 deadline to respond to James’ subpoena for documents.
The order has since been conditionally lifted, with Trump paying $110,000 in fines that are being held in escrow. 
During a court hearing held by video earlier Wednesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron declined to close out the contempt order until Trump’s lawyers filed additional affidavits from Trump employees about the document retention and destruction policy.
Trump has an appeal pending against the contempt order.
A lawyer for Ivanka and Don Jr. declined to comment. Trump’s lawyer and the AG’s office both did not immediately return requests for comment.
