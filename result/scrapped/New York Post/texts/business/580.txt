A star from the AMC hit series “Breaking Bad” has little sympathy for Americans complaining about record-high gas prices.
Dean Norris, who played the likable yet gullible DEA agent Hank Schrader in the critically acclaimed series, went viral on Twitter with a tweet on Wednesday in which he told those who “love capitalism” to “stfu.”
“You’re not getting ‘robbed’ at the pump,” Norris tweeted to his 742,000 followers on Twitter. 
“You’re paying fair market price for a commodity. If you love Capitalism so much then stfu.”
Norris’ brand of tough love did not go over well with some of his fans.
One Twitter follower, Ryan Palmer, tweeted: “Thanks to capitalism, we can complain about it. Thanks to capitalism, we can have hope that prices will eventually come down.”
Another Twitter user commented: “Easy to say when you have a net worth of 5 mil.”

“Dude just act and leave real life problems to the people who understand that stuff,” read another critical tweet.
Earlier this week, the average price of a gallon of regular fuel hit a nationwide record of $5.
On Thursday, the national average for regular unleaded hit $5.009, down slightly from the all-time high of $5.016 on Tuesday, according to AAA.
Soaring gas prices are the leading cause of record levels of inflation, which show no signs of easing up anytime soon.
Crude oil prices, which have spiked beyond $100 a barrel, now account for 60% of the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, according to April data from the federal Energy Information Administration.
The cost of crude shot up amid both increasing demand as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes and the global supply chain disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western-imposed sanctions.
Just a year ago, crude oil prices accounted for 52% of the cost of a gallon of gas – and only 25% of the cost during the COVID lockdowns of April 2020, the New York Times reported.
