A five-acre Long Island equestrian estate where over 100 racehorses have been bred has listed for $10 million. 
Located just 25 minutes from Belmont Park, where The 154th Belmont Stakes are set to take place over the weekend as the last leg of the Triple Crown, the estate is often used to breed thoroughbred racehorses. 
The mansion itself spans 15,000 square feet, and features paddocks, a riding ring, a 10-stall stable with an apartment and tack room, and an entertainment complex that comes with an in-ground heated, saltwater pool, water, spa, and a raised-bed cook’s garden and equestrian trails. 
But the extravagant property, referred to as the “Gold Coast,” isn’t just home to past horse racing champions, it has a bit of Hollywood history as well. 
Several movies and TV series have filmed at the house, including “The Loudest Voice” starring Russell Crowe, Seth McFarlane, Sienna Miller and Naomi Watts and “The Wolf of Wall Street,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie. 
Built in 2010, the main residence is made up of six bedrooms and nine bathrooms with an expansive gourmet kitchen, a guest suite, six fireplaces, an office, an elevator and a walk-out basement with a hot tub room. Other amenities include a wet bar and cabana bath. 
The main residence is made up of three levels and has several terraces and balconies that overlook paddocks. 
It is just also 45 minutes to the Hamptons and 50 minutes to Manhattan. 
Regina Rogers of Douglas Elliman holds the listing.
