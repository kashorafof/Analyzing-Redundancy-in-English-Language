Can’t get that Harry Styles song out of your head? We have good news for you. This summer you can sing along to all your favorite artists for free.
Here’s the beat drop: between June 21 and July 13, Amazon Prime members can score up to four months of Amazon Music Unlimited for no cost at all. Additionally, non-prime members are able to snatch up three free months of streaming when they sign up.  
With Amazon Music Unlimited, members have access to over 90 million songs. Curate your playlists with streaming hits like “Heat Waves,” “Good 4 U,” and “Slow Down Summer.” Or if music isn’t you’r thing, tune in to one of their podcast episodes. 
Plus, if something’s not sounding right, there’s unlimited skips. Since Amazon Music Unlimited is ad-free, you also don’t have to worry about your jam session being interrupted. 
This exclusive summer deal is music to our ears. But if for any reason you wish to cancel your Amazon Unlimited Music plan after the trial period is over, you can do so at no charge. 
Or if you’re still listening, Prime members can renew their Amazon Music Unlimited plan for $8.99 per month, and non-Prime members can keep streaming for $9.99 per month. 
Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan. At Just $14.95 a month, your entire family can listen to music on up to six different devices at the same time.
Score Amazon Music Unlimited free for four months until July 13, and enjoy over 90 million songs and podcasts. 
Sit back, plug in your favorite headphones, and let Amazon Music Unlimited do the rest.
