We’re moving out of the frying pan but into the oven for this launch, making it even easier to cook and bake in 2022. 
From the viral Always Pan to the coveted Perfect Pot, the folks at Our Place just keep cooking up one kitchen necessity after the other, and this launch is no different. 
Beginning today, June 22, the brand now carries ovenware with all the thrills and perks typical of Our Place cookware. 
The collection ($195) includes the Oven Pan, their version of a sheet pan, the Oven Mat, which is reusable parchment paper and the Bakers collection, which includes two sizes of pans called the Main Bake and the loaf-sized Tiny Bake.  
The entire Ovenware Set is nontoxic and nonstick, making for easy cookie baking, lasagna creations and so much more. Plus, each item comes in the iconic Our Place colors, starting with Spice, Blue Salt, Steam, Sage, and Char for this inaugural launch. 
If you think it couldn’t get any better, we have one more thing to share that may be the cherry on top of the freshly-baked cake. For those with limited space, you’ll be thrilled to find that the whole set easily nestles into each other, stacking three Bakers on top and the Oven Mat and Oven Pan on the bottom. 
Like always — and seen with the viral Always Pan — these launches can sell out in no time, so we advise you to act fast while this bakeware is still fresh and hot out of the oven.
