An intoxicated man died after he fell onto the tracks and hit his head in a Manhattan subway station Sunday morning, cops said.

He did not make contact with a train or the third rail, and was declared dead at Bellevue Hospital, police said. His cause of death was pending.
HIs identity wasn’t immediately released.
