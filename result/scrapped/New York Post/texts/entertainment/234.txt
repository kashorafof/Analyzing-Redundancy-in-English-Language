Come on, Barbie, let’s go party! 
Greta Gerwig’s upcoming “Barbie” movie is taking the internet by storm with neon pink convertibles, a shirtless Ken and fans of all ages.
The movie based on the plastic icon is set to hit theaters on July 21, 2023 starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.
Aside from Robbie’s (or, should we say Barbie’s) platinum blonde mane and hollywood beauty, the most striking part of the film is the brilliant fashion.
Since 1959, Barbie has been a fashion icon sporting everything from blue aerobics fits, chic tweed blazers and hot pink heels. It only makes sense that Robbie be styled in the same kitschy style. 
We’ve already spotted the actress in 80’s neon roller skating gear alongside Gosling and a bubblegum pink cowgirl fit adorned with stars and flared bottoms.

Barbie may simply call these dazzling closet choices “style,” but we’re calling them products of Barbiecore, the fashion trend based on the quintessential Mattel doll. 
The Barbiecore trend is quickly picking up speed with stars, such as Lizzo and Kim Kardashion, over-accessorizing and dressing in all-pink looks, while Gen Z launches into it full speed ahead. 
To prepare for the upcoming film and jump in on the monochromatic, Elle Woods trend, we listed our favorite Barbiecore fashion picks below — such as clear sunglasses, platform heels and everything pink. After all, “life in plastic is fantastic.”
It doesn’t get more retro than this. These Forever 21 jelly block heels come in neon green, pretty pink and clear glitter. A part of the brand’s Forever 21 x Barbie collection, you can dress up your doll-inspired look with a square toe, Barbie logo and a lug platform sole.
