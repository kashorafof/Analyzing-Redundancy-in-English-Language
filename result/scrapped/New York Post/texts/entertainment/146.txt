President Joe Biden is scheduled to appear on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Wednesday.  
The visit would be Biden’s first in-studio appearance on a late-night show since taking office in January 2021 and will be taped at the El Capitan Entertainment Centre on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.
Kimmel made the announcement during “Jimmy Kimmel Live: NBA Finals Game Night” on ABC as part of the network’s airing of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors.
In a tweet Sunday evening, Kimmel wrote “Our very elected President @JoeBiden visits @JimmyKimmelLive Wednesday night. No malarkey.”
Biden last came on Kimmel’s show in 2019 when he was fighting for the Democratic nomination.
While this is Biden’s first time in-studio interview as commander in chief, he was a virtual guest on NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in December 2021.
Kimmel’s show is on ABC starting at 11:35 p.m.
