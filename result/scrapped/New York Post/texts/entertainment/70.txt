The ’80s are back — at least according to the music charts. 
Metallica’s heavy metal epic “Master of Puppets” topped global charts this week after it was played in an episode of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” which is set in the 1980s.
The 8-minute-and-38-second-long title song from the band’s 1986 album is currently at the top spot on the iTunes rock chart and at the No. 29 overall spot on iTunes alongside many newly released hits. 
The guitar-heavy single was used during a pivotal scene involving the character Eddie in the season four finale. 
The show creators Matt and Ross Duffer wrote the scene with the exact song in mind, the show’s music supervisor Nora Felder said in an interview with Variety. 
“It was another one of those ‘it has to be this song,’ moments,” Felder said. “This part of the story was anticipated to be a pivotal and especially hair-raising scene in which Eddie heroically stood tall for the fight of his life. I believe the Duffer Brothers felt that playing ‘Master of Puppets’ throughout the extended scene was the clear choice.”
The headbanger is the second ’80s song to skyrocket up music charts after making it to the soundtrack of the show’s fourth season.
Over on Spotify, Kate Bush’s 1985 hit “Running Up That Hill” is at the coveted No. 1 spot on the USA Top 50 list after it was featured on “Stranger Things” season four. “Master of Puppets” is not far behind. It’s currently clocking in at No. 12. 
Bush’s hit was featured prominently in the first episode of season four as the angsty character Max listens to the British singer on her portable cassette player.
