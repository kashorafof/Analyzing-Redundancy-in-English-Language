A Queens man was hacked to death by his machete-wielding uncle in an ongoing feud over the family’s house, cops and neighbors told The Post on Sunday. 
Suspect Mahadeo Suhnandan, 50, is now awaiting arraignment for allegedly killing his 29-year-old nephew, Neraz Roberts, inside the home.
Roberts was pronounced dead at 88-27 187 Place in Jamaica around 5 a.m. with gashes to his back and hand, cops said.
Neighbor Ryan Basdeo, 24, said problems in the family began about 2 1/2 years ago when the owner of the house died, leaving her son, her daughter and Suhnandan, the daughter’s husband, to sort out the ownership of the two-story brick home, Badeo said. 
Both the son and his family, including his own offspring Roberts, and the daughter and her husband lived at the property.
“Since the mother died, they’ve been fighting,” he said. “Always cops coming here.”
Suhnandan allegedly had his brother-in-law kicked out, but Roberts still lived in a basement apartment there.
On Sunday, the feud turned bloody, with police saying Suhnandan used a machete to attack his nephew during the most recent fight.
“The son is the one in the basement who got stabbed,” Basdeo said. “He argues a little, but it’s really been [his] father and the uncle most of the time.”
