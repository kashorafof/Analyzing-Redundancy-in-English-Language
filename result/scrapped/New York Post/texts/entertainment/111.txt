A woman from the UK has revealed how she jetted off to New Jersey and became a stay-at-home wife.
The couple met online during the pandemic, and when the travel ban was lifted met up in real life.
The pair then got engaged and she then jetted off to join her husband in New Jersey – and her life has changed drastically.
In one TikTok video posted to her account, Monny Moves, she shared what a typical day in the life looks like as a New Jersey housewife.
She revealed she starts the day by making her and her husband a cup of espresso in the morning followed by a bowl of chia seed pudding for breakfast topped with fresh fruit.
After breakfast, it’s time to chill out from the hard work of being a housewife.
“And because being a housewife is obviously super stressful, I’m here by the pool drinking a flask of wine pretending I’m on vacation,” she explains.
After a busy morning of topping up her tan, the housewife gets herself glammed up for the rest of the day.
She said: “I do my hair and makeup so my husband doesn’t come home to a disheveled wife.”
Now she’s ready for the day, she explains it is time for more wine while she prepares dinner for when her husband gets home.
On the menu is pasta, but not just any old kind, it’s Dolce and Gabbana pasta because “New Jersey housewives are super boujie,” she jokes.
The housewife confirms she got the designer pasta as a bridal gift.
The video has gone viral racking up over 100k views, with the comments section inundated with women claiming she was living their dreams.
One wrote: “You are literally living my dream.”
“This is the dream,” another exclaimed.
A third penned: “How does it feel to live my dream?”
