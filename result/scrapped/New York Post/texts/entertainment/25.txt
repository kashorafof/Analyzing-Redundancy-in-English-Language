The sicko who allegedly pushed a woman onto Bronx subway tracks told cops he was drinking at the time and didn’t mean to commit the disturbing crime, according to court documents.
The comments by Theodore Ellis, 31, were revealed in a criminal complaint against him that was made public after his Wednesday arraignment at Bronx Criminal Court, where he was ordered held on $150,000 cash bail. 
Ellis has been charged with attempted murder,  assault, attempted assault and reckless endangerment for allegedly pushing a 52-year-old woman onto the roadbed at the Jackson Avenue station in Melrose on Sunday afternoon.
The woman suffered a broken collarbone, dislocated shoulder and head contusion in the random, unprovoked attack that was captured on surveillance video, according to the complaint. 
The victim was taken to Lincoln Hospital where she remained until Tuesday, police sources said. 
After the attack, Ellis told police “I didn’t mean to push her onto the tracks. I was drinking,” according to the court docs. 
He also admitted to police that he is the man seen shoving the woman in the video, the complaint says.
Chilling footage from the station shows Ellis allegedly grab the woman by her shoulders and whip her around off of the platform. 
Fellow commuters were able to pull the woman off the tracks and back to safety.
Ellis was busted Tuesday at the same Bronx subway station after an MTA worker recognized him from wanted posters. 
He has numerous prior arrests dating back to 2006, including raps for aggravated harassment, narcotics, robbery, grand larceny, animal abuse, resisting arrest, obstruction and assault.
His next court appearance is scheduled for June 10.
