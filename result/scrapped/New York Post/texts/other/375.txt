When all is said and done, the money you’re spending on toilet paper is just getting flushed down the drain. Many Americans are spending nearly $200 a year on toilet paper, and that’s not even counting if you have kids. The Aim to Wash! Smart Toilet Seat helps you cut down on toilet paper and have a comfortable seat on your porcelain throne. For a limited time, you can get this heated, advanced toilet seat on sale for $169.99 (Reg. $299). 
The Aim to Wash! Toilet seat can really make your toilet feel luxurious. The heated seat is adjustable for different temperatures and comfort levels. The soft-closing mechanism keeps your seat from slamming. That means it will last longer, and you don’t have to worry about dropping it at night and waking up the whole house. Speaking of night-time trips to the bathroom, it also comes with an adjustable LED toilet night light. No more burning your eyes in the full force of your bathroom fluorescents. 
This toilet seat goes even further than comfort. Built into the back of the seat are two warm-water nozzles that help men or women wash up after their business is concluded. Each nozzle is self cleaning too! Reduce your toilet paper usage by up to 100%. There’s even a warm air dryer that can get you dry in just 30 seconds. All of this is easy to operate and can be controlled from the base of the seat.
No fuss, just simple cleaning that’s done in an instant. As one Lowes reviewer writes, “Best quality, easy to install, hot water & hot seat are my favorites, and the LED light makes this product complete.” If you’re looking for a way to save money while making your toilet feel straight out of a 5-star hotel, this is how you do it. 
Every office deserves a comfortable seat. Get the Aim to Wash! Smart Toilet Seat on sale for $169.99 (Reg. $299).
