A man brutally slashed his girlfriend inside a Lower Manhattan subway station during the morning rush Tuesday — and was later nabbed wearing Kellogg’s “Apple Jacks” underwear, according to cops and photos.
Alleged attacker Billy Hernandez, 50, was in custody hours later with charges pending against him after getting picked up on South Street, law-enforcement sources said.
Exclusive photos by The Post show Hernandez wearing a red “New York” t-shirt and Kellogg’s “Apple Jacks” underwear staring at the camera with a matter-of-fact expression on his face. 
Earlier photos from the crime scene had captured the 49-year-old victim — identified by law-enforcement sources as Hernandez’s girlfriend — with a bloody bandage wrapped around her head and face and wearing a blood-soaked shirt.
A pool of blood could be seen on the floor at a cordoned-off area of the Fulton Street station where the attack allegedly occurred.

The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she was listed in stable condition.
Her beau fled after the attack but was later nabbed, cops said.
