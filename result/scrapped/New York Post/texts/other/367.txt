As tributes poured in Wednesday following Tony Siragusa’s death, an emotional interview from the Super Bowl champion’s past resurfaced online. 
During a sit-down with Howard Stern in 2012, Siragusa reflected on his own mortality as he discussed his father’s death from a heart attack. Siragusa’s dad passed away at the age of 48, while in his son’s arms.
“If I die tomorrow, I told my wife, just put a smile on my face. Put a little [Frank] Sinatra on,” Siragusa said at the time.
Siragusa died Wednesday at the age of 55. The former player-turned-Fox NFL analyst passed away in his sleep, per Pro Football Network.
A former defensive tackle, Siragusa — who was nicknamed the “Goose” — played for the Colts and Ravens during his 12-year NFL career, winning Super Bowl 35 with Baltimore in 2001.  
The interview clip included Siragusa discussing his time being bullied as “a short, fat kid” before he grew into his massive frame.
“My father was cool. He was the greatest dad ever,” Siragusa told Stern. “You would get a spanking… ‘respect’ was the biggest word ever. You walk in my house, I don’t care who you are, my kids will get up, look you in the eye and shake your hand.”

He also recalled a story about the one time he told his father “no” and the day his father passed away. 
Siragusa amassed 564 tackles and 22 sacks in his career.
Members of the NFL community mourned Siragusa’s death Wednesday afternoon, including Colts owner Jim Irsay who tweeted, “The Goose, Tony Siragusa has passed away at 55. I’m heart broken as is all of Colts Nation.”
Siragusa’s passing came hours after the Ravens announced the death of linebacker Jaylon Ferguson, who was 26 years old.
