The bride wears her sparkly wedding shoes, and the groom gets a new tie. The bridesmaids wear their new summer party dresses, and guests wear cocktail attire or whatever festive suggestion the wedding invite says. 
The entire guest list will be dressed to the nines. So how about jewelry? Whether in the bridal party or merely a happy onlooker, your wedding attire isn’t complete without some new jewels.
The online jewelry retailer, Blue Nile, is well aware of such celebratory sartorial suggestions and has decided to mark down select styles up to 40% off during the brand’s Wedding Event.
The sale runs until July 17 and includes men’s and women’s rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. Best of all, Blue Nile offers fast, free shipping and returns.
