If sweet cheese and your favorite yellow nail polish had a baby, it would pretty much look like Nails Inc.’s latest collaboration with Velveeta.
If you thought Oscar Meyer’s bologna face mask was one of the most ridiculous (yet incredibly trending) partnerships of the year, think again. 
The aromas of gooey gruyère and sharp swiss you adore aren’t meant for just your refrigerator pull-out drawer, either. According to Nails Inc., those seductive, savory scents should live on your nails.
So, enter the cheesiest collaboration that we don’t think anyone — and we mean anyone — asked for, yet is up-ticking in trends: Nails Inc. x Velveeta’s cheese-scented nail polish.
Some may think it’s definitively disgusting, while others think it’s so iconic that they must order it ASAP (it sold out on Amazon within nine hours!). However, you can still grab the polish — and the accompanying stickers — on Nails Inc.’s website.
So, what’s the deal? This mouth-watering set is nothing you’ve ever experienced, offering highly pigmented formulas that, when fully dried, will make you drool over your sudden cheese craving.
What’s more, Nails Inc. and Velveeta didn’t stop at just the polish. Pick up the collaboration’s That’s La Dolce Velveeta Irresistible Nail Stickers if you want to join the cheese frenzy without the scent.
Impressively enough — and just like your preferred organic cheeses — the limited-edition cheese-scented nail polish is 100% vegan and cruelty-free. 
We didn’t expect to be writing about anything cheese-scented this year — as our forté lies in product reviews, gift guides and the best women’s fashion items to shop, to name a few — but we’re so laughing in our seats about this buzzy beauty buy.
