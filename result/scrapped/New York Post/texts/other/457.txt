This caffeinated beverage bro has bought himself an unprecedentedly expensive home. 
Billionaire Russell Weiner, who created the drink company Rockstar Energy in 2001, just paid a state record of $39.6 million for a ski pad in Park City, Utah.
The seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom, 17,567-square-foot mountain crib is named Monitor’s Rest and is nestled into a mountainside and composed of 5 ski-in/ski-out acres in the gated of enclave of the Colony at White Pine Canyon, according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.com (the Wall Street Journal first reported the deal). 
The home’s wellness amenities are even more impressive than many commercial spas and include a 60-foot indoor/outdoor stainless steel pool, a spa and gym, a Himalayan salt room, a cold plunge pool, a hot tub, a hammam ice fountain, an infrared sauna and massage room — not to mention a new-fangled “Home Wellness Intelligence Network,” which can purportedly regulate circadian rhythm lighting and calibrate air quality. 
There’s also an indoor sports court equipped for volleyball, basketball and pickleball. It also features a climbing wall, a golf simulator and a bowling alley.
For more entertainment-oriented downtime, there’s a digital cinema laser projection system and, to enhance the surrounding natural wonders, a “panoramic tower” ideally situated to take-in the trees and landscaped local granite boulders, the listing boasts.
The main level has a bar, billiards, a floating fireplace, ping pong tables and “massive motorized retractable walls of floor-to-ceiling glass.” “We really wanted to do something a bit different in the Park City market, up the ante as far as what can be done for a high-end, legacy-quality ski house,” Daivd Ostrander, co-founder of the home’s developer, Iluminus Group, told the Wall Street Journal.
