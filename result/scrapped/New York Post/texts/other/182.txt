Two attackers pushed a 65-year-old Asian woman to the ground and took her purse as she strolled on a tree-lined Queens street Sunday morning, cops said.
The victim was walking at 155th Street and 35th Avenue in Murray Hill when the robbers approached her and shoved her around 9 a.m., cops said.
The two crooks snatched the purse out of her hands, cops said. There was no immediate description of the robbers, cops said.
Cops said they are not investigating the crime as bias-related at this point.
