San Franciscans disgusted with rampant lawlessness showed pro-perp District Attorney Chesa Boudin the door last week in a landslide recall election. Yet New Yorkers fed up with soft-on-crime Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, will have to wait until 2026 to be rid of him — or replace Gov. Kathy Hochul with someone who’s got the guts to oust him sooner.
New York law doesn’t allow for recall votes; only the gov can oust DAs for failing to do their job. 
Yet Bragg made clear from the start that he’d put the interests of criminals first: His “Day 1 Memo” outlined all the crimes he’d refuse to prosecute and sentences he’d refuse to seek, even for felons. That drew such outrage that he backtracked — but only slightly. Since then, he’s pursued his top goal, freeing perps, with gusto: 
That’s just a sample of Bragg’s dereliction. And with crime still surging, it’s clear the bad guys have gotten his message: In New York, Bragg will let you slide.
All the Republican candidates for governor and one Democratic one, Tom Suozzi, have vowed to boot Bragg if he won’t do his job. Yet Hochul won’t even criticize him.
If New Yorkers want to follow San Francisco’s example and get rid of their Manhattan DA, they’ll have to fire Hochul first.
