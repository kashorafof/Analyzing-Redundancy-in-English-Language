What’s hotter than reading? Streaming! Lucky for you, it’s never been easier to do.
Through July 31, Audible is offering a free, three-month trial of their exclusive, Audible Premium Plus plan.
Whether you’ve had your eye on the latest bestseller or you’re a true crime podcast junkie, Audible is the best audio service for convenient listening, wherever and whenever you want. 
With many more days of summer on the horizon, it’s not too late to dive into some of the best books on audible, like “One Italian Summer,” “Island Time,” and “The Golden Couple.”
While Audible has enough audiobooks to keep you streaming for over 60,000 hours (that’s almost seven years straight), users also have access to a diverse catalog of other content, such as documentaries, comedy bits and selections from Audible theater. There’s no reason to buy more paper books when you can have this plethora of Audible options at the ready. 
The deal doesn’t stop there. Those who take advantage of this impressive offer also receive one monthly credit to spend on any title from the premium selection. Plus, users also score an extra 30% off on additional premium selection titles. Free membership? Free content? Yes, you heard that right. 
After the trial period expires, the ball is in your court. If you decide to cancel your Audible subscription, you will still have access to all the titles you purchased. Or, for just $14.95 a month, it’s not hard to convince yourself to stick around as a Premium Plus member. 
Take a page out of our book and snatch up this deal while it lasts. 
Score Audible Premium Plus free for three months until July 31 to unlock one credit per month, thousands of Audible originals, and exclusive discounts.
