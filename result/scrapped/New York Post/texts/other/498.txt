This palatial estate is surprisingly affordable.
A sprawling home in El Paso, Texas, is asking the same price as many Brooklyn apartments for exponentially more space: $2.5 million. 
The manse at 331 Wild Willow Drive measures more than 13,200 square feet, including a columned entry and multiple windowed turrets. 
The property features 10 bedrooms, 12.5 bathrooms, a home theater, two laundry rooms, a dance studio “and so much more,” boasts its listing, with Gabriel Mendez of the Greater El Paso Association of Realtors. The “breathtaking home located in the desirable Willow Bend Subdivision is a must see,” the listing continues, and the internet agrees. The address has achieved a certain viral fame for its rather bizarre combination of classical architectural elements, stucco siding and sheer size. 
The enormous, pillared entryway is inexplicably full of Egyptian-styled statues strategically placed about the tiled floor. Carpeted stairs lead to a second story full of loudly painted bedrooms. Other highlights include full wall murals of what appears to be ancient Egypt (the listing makes no note of them) and a tiled area that seems to be in use as a basketball court. The listing also makes note of a balcony, a “4 car or more” attached garage, a custom kitchen bar and plenty of ceiling fans. 
The Instagram account ZillowGoneWild called the property “the best deal for a mansion we’ve ever seen” although commenters were less than enthused about it. 
“I’ll paso,” reads the posts most-liked comment.
