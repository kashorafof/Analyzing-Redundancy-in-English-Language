The numbers are in for the recently concluded 2021-22 TV season.
As we enter the summer programming lull, it’s a good time to take a look back at what viewers watched in primetime on network television during the period stretching from last September through mid-May.
With so many viewing options available on so many different platforms, the days of a network series generating blockbuster viewership appear to be long-gone — even with delayed viewership  — but these dramas, comedies and reality shows managed to retain a good chunk of their loyal audiences in the age of digital TV and a fractured viewer landscape.
Here are the top five shows in each genre on the broadcast networks, measured by their average weekly total viewership (according to Nielsen).
DRAMAS:
“NCIS” (CBS): 11 million.
“FBI” (CBS): 10.4 million.
“Chicago Fire” (NBC): 9.9 million.
“Blue Bloods” (CBS): 9.8 million.
“The Equalizer” (CBS): 9.5 million.
