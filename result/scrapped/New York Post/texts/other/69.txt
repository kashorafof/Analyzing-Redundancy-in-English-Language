Paul Pierce is being sued for an alleged six-figure gambling debt stemming from high-stakes poker games. 
Stephen Carmona filed a lawsuit against the NBA legend and is seeking $180,000, plus interest, in regard to the money he supposedly lent Pierce, who subsequently lost it in poker games and never paid it back, according to TMZ Sports. 
Carmona claims that on one occasion he loaned Pierce $150,000, of which $140,000 was lost and only $10,000 returned. Further, Carmona alleges he lent an additional $40,000 to Pierce the following week for a game, which was also lost.
Pierce allegedly promised to repay Carmona, but did not “despite multiple requests for repayment,” according to the suit. 
It is well known that Pierce habitually plays in high-stakes poker games. In fact, he’s played in the World Series of Poker a number of times and also appeared in a now-viral video captured during a friend’s poker night, that featured smoking, drinking and cavorting with strippers.
Pierce is also no stranger to being sued.

Last month, Pierce was sued over an alleged cryptocurrency “pump and dump,” according to the New York Times. He faced a lawsuit in 2020 over a marijuana business deal gone bad, and was sued five years prior by his Manhattan landlord for allegedly leaving his apartment in “shambles.”
