Chafing, chub rub, or whatever nickname you have for it, when the sun is out and the thighs are rubbing, it can be game over for summer fun. 
Thigh chafing, or any chafing, is when skin rubs against skin, creating friction burns and bumps that can be red, itchy or even painful in the summer heat. Chafing can also lead to a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, a fancy term for inflammation and infection of sweat glands due to rubbing or friction. 
This can mean many choose to ditch cute shorts, dresses, and even bathing suits and opt for pants that offer better protection between your legs. 
However, in the summer heat, being too covered up isn’t the best option, and no one wants to overheat at a pool party or the beach.
