Olivia Culpo just wants to have fun.
The former Miss Universe winner, 30, posted a collection of videos to Instagram on Monday from her getaway with sisters Aurora and Sophia, including the moment she broke a playful “promise” to her boyfriend, Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, 26.
In the clip, which was also shared on her TikTok page, Culpo and a pal are seen mimicking an exchange from “The Office,” with her friend mouthing Dwight Schrute’s line, “I need you to promise me that you’ll be on your best behavior.” Culpo, channeling her inner-Jim Halpert, then replies, “I promised other people that I’d be on my worst behavior, and I gave them my word so.”
When your assistant is forced to come on every single work trip/vacation/“retreat”/, bachelorette weekend and tries to draw the line 😂… bikini is @Revolve @LoveWave
Culpo then added additional commentary to her Instagram Story, writing, “Christian before every girls trip.”
The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model has been dating McCaffrey since 2019, with the pair slated to celebrate their third anniversary together this month. The two are also proud pet parents to an adorable pup named Oliver Sprinkles, whom Culpo seemed to yearn for Monday night.
In a separate video, Culpo is seen petting a statue of a dog in what appears to be the hotel lobby, with sister Sophia quipping on her Instagram Story, “One too many margaritas @oliviaculpo.”
“You know you miss your dog when…,” Culpo added.
Oliver Sprinkles recently joined Culpo and McCaffrey for the Pro Bowler’s birthday celebrations this month, when the family of three enjoyed a cozy night in with a side of Netflix.
