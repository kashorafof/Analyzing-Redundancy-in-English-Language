Shopping is never a bad idea — especially when it’s shopping designer-loved brands.
The best part about shopping for high-end items is that you don’t always have to pay full price. You can add top fashion brands, such as Tom Ford, Celine and Allen Edmonds, to your carts at discounted prices during the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2022. 
The stellar shopping event brings new arrivals from more than 100 brands — including luxury finds — and kicks off with early access to Nordstrom Nordy Club members on July 6. The sale opens to the general public on July 15 until July 31. Below, you can find the full sale dates and details.
Though, you should know that quantities are limited and designer brands are going to fly off the shelves left and right. After all, who doesn’t want a Ted Baker coat for over $200 off or a Chloé Eau de Parfum Set for just $102? 
To make sure you don’t miss out on grandeur finds, start building your designer wishlist now by accessing the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale preview and shopping as soon as your sale date hits. 
Get shopping and adding to your wishlist by checking out our men and women’s Nordstrom Anniversary Sale designer picks below. And don’t forget to shop the rest of the sale, which includes categories such as women, men, kids, home, beauty, kitchen and more.
