Federal officials opened up an investigation this month into another infant death possibly linked to Abbott Laboratories — the nation’s largest baby formula manufacturer. 
The baby died in January and had “consumed an Abbott product,” the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday, citing a consumer complaint sent to the agency in February.
The FDA was made aware of the complaint on June 10.
“The investigation of this most recent consumer complaint is in its preliminary stages and the agency will provide an update as it learns more,” the agency wrote in a statement.
It was unclear what product the baby consumed, or if it was tied to the Abbott Laboratories plant that shut down in February amid a rash of bacteria infections, worsening a nationwide formula shortage that began during the pandemic
Abbott’s Sturgis, Michigan plant closed and issued recalls after the feds investigated four infections of infants who were fed formula made at the plant. Two of the babies died from the rare infections.
Abbott reopened the plant earlier this month after the FDA was unable to definitively link the sicknesses to the company, which produces Similac. The feds did find numerous violations at the facility including poor sanitary conditions and safety procedures.
“While there are actions we need to take to address the FDA observations, it is important to note that no Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella was found in any of our testing of products distributed to consumers,” the company said last month.
The FDA had previously investigated 128 complaints, including nine deaths, possibly linked to Abbott formulas, but could only tie four of them to the nutrition company.
Abbott Laboratories stock was up about 1% Wednesday following the FDA’s disclosure.
