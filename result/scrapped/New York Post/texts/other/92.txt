Police in Bradenton, Florida, responded to a call from a Dollar General Thursday night when an unruly, slobbery customer wouldn’t leave the store at closing time. 
Turns out Bentley, a 135-pound Saint Bernard, was the thrifty shopper.  
The big fellow broke through a gate and walked into the store, where he spent a couple of hours looking around. Store employees let him wander until it was time to lock up, calling police for reinforcements. 
Bentley’s in-store experience was captured on surveillance cameras. He later reunited with his owner, which was caught by bodycam footage.
