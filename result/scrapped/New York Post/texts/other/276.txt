Are your eyes playing tricks on you or is there more than meets the eye in this pink circle?
An optical illusion shared by content creator @pasillusion may leave you second guessing your eyesight, as the TikTok trickster claims to have a “secret image” hidden in plain sight.
The image looks as though it’s a simple bubblegum pink square with a darker pink circle inside — but the user claims there is a ‘hidden image’ inside the circle — that only 1% of people can see.
“Can YOU See The Hidden Image?! Let me know,” the Tikoker captioned the video, which was posted to his 5,800 followers.
There was a variety in the comments of what people claimed to see — or not see.

TikTok users clamed to see a number of objects — a bed, a boat, a smile and even a boat. But the majority people who reported seeing an image in the circle said they could make out the shape of a bottle.

It’s not the only picture claiming to have a hidden image only a select few can view. TikTok user Rana Ashard shared a tricky picture to his “illusions” account showing a drawing of an old man’s face with a beard and hair, with varied responses as to what people could see.
If you were in the 1% off people that could see the hidden image, you may be able to spot the hidden celebrity in this black-and-white grid.
Although optical illusions are usually just a harmless diversion from the stresses of a typical day fun — they also hold real-life value for scientists. The brain teasers reportedly help researchers shed light on the inner machinations of the mind — and how it reacts to its surroundings.
Dr Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at Goldsmiths University in London, told The Sun that such illusions are actually important to increasing our understanding of the brain: “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you.”
