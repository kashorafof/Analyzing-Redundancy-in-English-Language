There is no shortage of delicious summer treats, so a new, ice-based dessert’s flavor profile would have to really stand out.
Enter the “Frenchsicle,” a ketchup-flavored popsicle created by French’s, best known for their condiments — and now, for a limited time only, a polarizing popsicle flavor.
Available at pop-up locations in Canada until June 24, French’s is foraying into the dessert world in collaboration with Happy Pops, a local Canadian business specializing in all-natural ice pops made from real fruit and sweetened with organic cane sugar.
According to a press release, the dubious tomato-based dessert is from 100% Canadian tomatoes and “combines some of the best traditions the season has to offer: ketchup and popsicles.”
However, as appealing as that description may be, it has done little to convince the general public to give it a go.
“I love ketchup as much is the next person. But this is horrifying,” one Twitter user wrote in response to the news.
“Canada, please tell me this is a joke,” another wrote. “You all don’t actually eat ketchup popsicles when literally every other dessert exists.”
“Do you know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing not to make ketchup popsicles out of them,” another Twitter user said.

Others were keen to collaborate on more flavors.
“Do you have a mayo one?” a user responded to the news, with another saying they’d opt for a “half mayo half ketchup swirl.”
The startling flavor is for a good cause, though, with French’s donating two meals to Food Banks Canada to address food insecurity in Canada for every Frenchsicle given away.
Unfortunately, if you are keen to get your hands on some ketchup-flavored fun, you’ll have to cross the border to give it a try, as the popsicles are only available in Toronto and Ontario. But there is a recipe available online for those who dare to enter the world of ketchup-flavored desserts.
