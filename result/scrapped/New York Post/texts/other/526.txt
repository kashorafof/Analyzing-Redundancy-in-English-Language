Life’s a beach for President Biden.
Shortly after the president and first lady Jill Biden were taken to a safe house after a private plane violated the air space around the home they own in Rehoboth Beach, Del., on Saturday, he was spotted at a nearby beach in shorts. 
The photo of the president, wearing a ball cap and carrying a couple of tote bags through the sand around 3 p.m., was obtained by Fox News. 
A couple of hours earlier, the president was rushed to a fire station by the Secret Service after the plane was detected.
“Shortly before 1 p.m. today a privately owned aircraft entered the restricted airspace over Rehoboth Delaware after mistakenly entering a secured area,” the US Secret Service said in a statement. “The aircraft was immediately escorted out of the restricted airspace.”
The pilot was not following published flight guidance, the Secret Service said.
Following the intrusion, Biden was taken back to his residence in Rehoboth. 
He had no events on his daily White House schedule.
