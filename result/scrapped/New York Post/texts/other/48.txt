Justin Timberlake is asking for fans’ forgiveness after a video of him dancing went viral for all the wrong reasons.
The “Cry Me a River” singer issued an apology to Washington, DC, in an Instagram Story after fans compared his attempt at the area’s famous Beat Ya Feet dance he did onstage at the Something in the Water music festival to him doing the hokey pokey.
“DC, I want to apologize to you for two reasons: Here, and here,” Timberlake said, panning down to his feet. 
“I had a long talk with both of them, individually,” he said of his two seemingly left feet. “And I warned ‘Don’t you ever do that to me again.”‘
For the now infamous performance, Timberlake donned casual khaki pants, orange sneakers and a green button-down for his performance.
“Maybe it was the khakis. It was a real khaki vibe,” he reflected on Wednesday. 
Timberlake promised he would bring “SexyBack” and spend time on his footwork.
“Love you all,” he smiled, ending the video. 
DC! BEAT YOUR FEET! Did Justin Timberlake get off at @sitw ? 😂🔥 @jtimberlake pic.twitter.com/cSS6YhTt33
When the video began circulating on social media, fans were less than impressed. 
“JT did not just say ‘beat your feet’ and proceed to river dance & skip. Boy if you don’t get your a– off the stage,” mocked one Twitter user.
“Justin Timberlake said ‘DC beat your feet’ and proceeded to do the hokey pokey,” noted another.
“Justin Timberlake your DC pass is revoked until further notice,” wrote another person.
The festival took place on Washington’s Independence Avenue between June 17 and June 19 and was riddled with technical issues. It was apparently so disorganized that performances did not happen on time and there was a heavy influx of traffic.
