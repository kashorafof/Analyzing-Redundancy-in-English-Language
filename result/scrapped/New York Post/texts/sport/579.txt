The Pittsburgh Pirates and Atlanta Braves will meet for the second of a three-game set tonight (7:20 p.m. ET) and Anthony Dabbundo of The Action Network is here to share his best bet (video above). 
For Dabbundo, the game features two promising starting pitchers – Roansy Contreras for the Pirates and Spencer Strider for the Braves – but he gives a pitching edge to the Pirates. 
So far this season, Strider has established himself as a pitcher that tries to strike everybody out.

“[Strider has] a below-average first-pitch strike rate [and] he runs a lot of deep counts,” Dabbundo explains. 
Plus, either when starting or coming out the bullpen, Strider has struggled when it comes to his walk rate, often leading him into troubling situations. As a result, Dabbundo is concerned about the Braves’ starting pitcher, especially as this big a favorite. 
On the flip-side, Contreras has come out of the bullpen and produced quality starts of late. In three starts, Contreras has walked just three batters per nine innings and possesses an xERA, FIP, and xFIP all below 3.3. 
Add in that Contreras has an actual ERA of only 1.93 through those three starts, and Dabbundo believes he is the more complete starting pitcher at this moment in time. 
So, although Dabbundo believes the Braves have a superior lineup to the Pirates, he’s choosing to back Pittsburgh (+180) for his best bet as a result of his confidence in Contreras.
