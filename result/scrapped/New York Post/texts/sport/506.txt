Whether Megan Fox is having a PDA moment with fiancé Machine Gun Kelly or debuting a new tattoo, she is always making waves. This is especially true when it comes to the actress’ fashion forward looks, such as the leopard and lace dress she rocked at friend Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s luxe wedding in Portofino, Italy.
Now, the 36-year-old is taking her fashion expertise to new heights.
On June 7, Fox partnered with global fashion e-retailer, Boohoo, for the second time to launch the Megan 2.0 Collection.
The Megan 2.0 summer collection, born with the help of her stylist Maeve Reilly, focuses on female empowerment, as the dynamic duo believe that fashion should be daring and inclusive. The end result? A collection that celebrates individuality and helps shoppers feel confident and sexy throughout the season.
“I am so excited to introduce my latest collection to my fans! Partnering with Boohoo has brought my personal creativity and style to life,” shared Fox in a press release. “This new collection showcases a gorgeous color palette fitting for the season. Keeping in theme with the first collection, the styles are incredibly sexy and bold — two things I personally try to embody with my style choices. Megan Fox 2.0 is a collection that will empower everybody and I’m excited for everyone to rock it in their own way.” 
Shoppers can look forward to over 40 various styles encompassing statement colors, monochromatic bold suits, baggy boyfriend jeans, sexy cut out dresses, on-trend sparkly mini skirts, crisp button down shirts and more.
Best of all, the collection is available in US sizes 2 to 24 and starts at the low price of $12. To shop this trend-forward collection, head over to Boohoo.com, or check out our selects below.
