Clint Frazier continues to take every opportunity to bash his former team.
The current Chicago Cub and former Yankee spoke to the Chicago Sun-Times ahead of the weekend series between the two teams, the first since Frazier signed a $1.5 million deal to head to the midwest in the offseason. As he has been wont to do, the 27-year-old threw some shade at his time playing in the Bronx.
‘‘I like it here,’’ Frazier said of Chicago. ‘‘Certainly don’t miss some of the things over there. And I’m really enjoying the way that this clubhouse has maneuvered. It seems like there’s a lot of guys in here that are just accepting of everyone. And it’s been really good for me.
“You had to be a cookie-cutter version to be on that team,” he continued of the Yankees. “If not, then you were like a really bad distraction, it seemed like. So I don’t miss being told how I had to look for the last five years.”
Frazier has since grown a beard since joining the Cubs, but he hasn’t grown his portfolio on the field. The outfielder is garnering limited playing time on the 23-33 squad. He only has 45 plate appearances in 19 games this season while dealing with injuries. In those at-bats, he is hitting .216 with a .653 OPS and no home runs.
Since returning from the injured list in late May, he has started five games and made pinch-hit appearances in three others. It seems likely the Yankees will see him in their weekend series in the Bronx.
Frazier has expressed his happiness about leaving New York several times. After he signed with the Cubs, a fan tweeted that he was “so glad this dude isn’t a Yankee anymore.” Frazier quote tweeted it and said, “So am I,” with a series of crying-laughing emojis.
