Arsenal have completed the signing of Fábio Vieira from Porto, with manager Mikel Arteta describing the Portuguese midfielder as a “special talent.”
Vieira came through Porto’s youth system and helped Sergio Conceição’s side win the league and cup double last season. He scored six goals and provided 14 assists and has cost Arsenal €35m (£30m) plus €5m in add-ons. The 22-year has signed a “long-term contract” with the London club.
“This is an important step forward in my career,” said Vieira. “Arsenal is a huge and historic club, so I’m delighted to be here at my new home. I feel it’s the right move in my career. I think it will be really good for me and I have no regrets about it. I’m thrilled to be here.”
Vieira will wear the No 21 shirt having become Arsenal’s second signing of the summer, following the arrival of 19-year-old Brazilian forward Marquinhos from São Paulo.
Bem-vindo, Fabio ❤️
“I am very excited that we have identified and signed such a special talent,” said Arteta. “Fábio is a very creative player that will bring high quality and versatility to our attacking play. We welcome Fábio and his family to our club and are looking forward to starting work with him ahead of the new season.”
Arsenal’s technical director, Edu, added: “We’re so pleased to have completed the signing of Fabio. He is a player with special qualities who is comfortable with the ball in the final third of the pitch. We are all looking forward to working with him and enjoying his future contribution to Arsenal.”
Arsenal are now expected to move for Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus, their primary summer target. City reportedly want £50m for the Brazil international.
