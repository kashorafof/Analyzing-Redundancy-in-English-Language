Ukrainian forces have been pushed back by a Russian bombardment in the frontline eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and now only control its outskirts, according to the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai.
Speaking to the RBC-Ukraine media outlet, Haidai said it made no sense for Ukrainian special forces to stay inside the city after Russia started levelling the area with shelling and air strikes.
Regional leaders had said Ukrainian forces might have to “pull back” to stronger positions in Sievierodonetsk amid heavy fighting in the city and frontline villages to the south as Russia pursues a breakthrough in Donbas.
It was “impossible” to say that Sievierodonetsk had been completely seized by Russian troops, Haidai said, adding:
Our (forces) now again control only the outskirts of the city. But the fighting is still going on, our (forces) are defending Sievierodonetsk, it is impossible to say the Russians completely control the city.
Haidai had earlier insisted that a retreat was not being planned. “Do not breed betrayal. Do not spoil the mood of the armed forces! Nobody is going to surrender Sievierodonetsk!” he said, adding that Ukraine’s defenders would fight for “every inch”.
Russian president Vladimir Putin said that domestically manufacturing goods to circumvent Western sanctions over Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine was not a cure-all solution, adding that Russia is now seeking out new trade partners.
“The substitution of imports is not a panacea,” Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs. The group expressed concerns over a lack of imported goods in their attempts to develop vaccines.
“We are not trying to completely replace imports,” Putin said, adding that Russia “must collaborate with those it is possible to collaborate with”.
“But for critically important technologies, we have to have our own know-how,” he said. “We are developing them.”
After Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in February, Western countries have imposed harsh sanctions on Russia that include import and export restrictions which have debilitated supply chains. 
Russia’s pharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on imports. Authorities announced in April that they had built three factories in Moscow to produce medicines to ease the blow of the import ban. 
That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine.
Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3am.
Civilian evacuations continue across Ukraine as many flee in armoured cars and buses to safety.
Western-supplied artillery systems are already making a difference on the ground for Ukraine and it is “just a question of time” before its forces win back significant ground in the south, the governor of the Mykolaiv region said on Wednesday.
Governor Vitaliy Kim, whose region is partially occupied by Russia but remains just one of two that retains significant access to the Black Sea, told Reuters that Ukrainian forces had “some success” in recent weeks in a counterattack in the neighbouring Kherson region.
Asked when western weapons would start to make a difference on the ground against Russian forces, he said: “It is already happening ... and we will have (more) success.”
“We are talking about artillery,” he said. “It is already working in our region.” He declined to say what specific western artillery systems were working there.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk - where the fate of Donbas is being decided - is probably the most difficult seen so far during the war, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said.
Addressing the nation late on Wednesday evening, he said:
Sievierodonetsk remains the epicentre of the confrontation in Donbas. We defend our positions, inflict significant losses on the enemy.
[The] battle for Sievierodonetsk is probably one of the most difficult during this war, and in particular the fate of Donbas is being decided there.
 This is a very fierce battle, very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war. 
I am grateful to everyone who defends this direction. In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there.”
Zelenskiy described Donetsk as a “ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects”.
“Only the return of Ukraine, which will definitely happen, only our flag and only Ukrainian law will mean a normal life for these territories, for these cities - again. The life that was there. Peaceful, safe, open to the world,” he added.
That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you.
“Russia has been waging digital war against Ukrainian since 2014,” Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation George Dubinskiy said in an interview on Wednesday. 
Speaking to France 24, Dubinskiy said that in addition to defending its land borders, Ukraine is also defending its digital ones.

A British man fighting in Ukraine has been captured by pro-Russian separatists, an international legion backing the Kyiv government said on Wednesday.
Agence-France Presse reports: 
“It was announced in the Ukrainian press that the Russians had completed a criminal investigation against three foreigners whom they were preparing to put on trial and that they risked the death penalty,” Damien Magrou, spokesman for the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine (LIDU) told AFP.
“One of the three names mentioned in the article, Andrew Hill, is a legionnaire who has a contract with the Ukrainian army,” he added.
Magrou stressed that under the Geneva Convention Hill should be considered a prisoner of war, and treated as such.
According to the LIDU, Hill has been held “in captivity for some weeks” by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
“Executing prisoners is a war crime,” it said.
The international legion had given the names of a Dutchman, an Australian, a German and a Frenchman, without specifying the date or circumstances of their death.
Russia claimed this week that it had killed “hundreds” of foreign fighters in Ukraine since the start of its invasion in February.
Ukraine has received the first billion dollars of the $40 billion aid package that the US Congress approved last month. 
In a tweet on Wednesday, US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A Brink said, “Supporting Ukraine means strengthening its economy. Direct support of $1 billion is already here to help Ukraine and its people move forward...” 
Як я сказала економічному керівництву України у @mineconomdev @MinFin_Ukraine @NBUkraine, підтримка України означає зміцнення її економіки. Пряма підтримка в розмірі $1 мільярда вже тут, щоб допомогти Україні та її народу рухалися вперед, і ще $7,5 мільярда очікується. pic.twitter.com/McAKa20APz
Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov tweeted on Wednesday that he has been placed on the country’s national and international wanted list. 
Now I know a bit more about my case. It was launched by the Investigative committee bc of my interview to @politica_media “FSB generals arrested because of the war” so I have a pretty good idea who is behind it. And I’m on Russia’s national but also international wanted list. pic.twitter.com/EMStlehJJN
Soldatov is the editor-in-chief of Agentura.ru, a website that focuses on Russia’s secret services’ activities. He has been accused of spreading misinformation about the Russian military. 
According to Russia’s interior ministry, Soldatov “is wanted for violating an article of the Criminal Code.” The ministry’s website did not include additional dertails.
