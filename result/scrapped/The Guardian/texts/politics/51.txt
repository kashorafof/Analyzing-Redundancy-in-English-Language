Boris Johnson won a vote of confidence yesterday – but he suffered a massive rebellion from parliamentary colleagues. Political correspondent Peter Walker explains what happens now

If 15% of Tory MPs put in writing their desire to change leader, then a confidence vote in the incumbent is declared. That threshold was crossed on Monday and Boris Johnson faced the same win-or-lose moment that his predecessor Theresa May had to endure. Like May, Boris Johnson emerged from the vote with the confidence of a majority of his MPs: 211 to 148. But has it fatally damaged him nonetheless?
Political correspondent Peter Walker tells Hannah Moore that the Conservatives are now in open civil war mode. Cabinet minister Nadine Dorries spent part of Monday publicly lambasting leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt. And the day began with a ferocious denunciation of Johnson’s character and his leadership from his former backer Jesse Norman.
Johnson is now expected to attempt a fightback with another reshuffle of his ministers. But more danger awaits with two tricky byelections in the calendar later this month. While Tory party rules currently say a sitting leader gets a year’s grace once they win a confidence vote, rules can be subject to change with enough demand in the party.
