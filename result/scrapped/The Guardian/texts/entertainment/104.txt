Ukraine won the Eurovision song contest 2022 with a song mixing rap with elements of Ukrainian folk music. A tidal wave of public support saw the entrants, Kalush Orchestra, move from eighth place after the jury votes to first place, as they were awarded a staggering 492 points. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed the victory, and said the country would 'do its best' to host the contest in the port city of Mariupol one day. Zelenskiy and Kalush Orchestra said any victory was meaningful for Ukraine at this time. The UK also had an exciting night, as Sam Ryder had a considerable lead at the halfway point and placed second overall with his song Space Man. This is the highest the UK have ranked since 1998
