Alec John Such, the bassist and a founding member of Bon Jovi, has died. He was 70.
Jon Bon Jovi on Sunday announced the death of Such, the New Jersey rock band’s bassist from 1983 to 1994. No details of when or how he died were immediately available. 
“He was an original,” Jon Bon Jovi wrote in a post on Twitter. “As a founding member of Bon Jovi, Alec was integral to the formation of the band.”

Jon Bon Jovi, 60, credited Such for bringing the band together, noting that he was a childhood friend of drummer Tico Torres and brought guitarist and songwriter Richie Sambora to see the band perform. Such had played in a band called the Message with Sambora.
Such, born in Yonkers, New York, was a veteran figure on the thriving New Jersey music scene that helped spawn Bon Jovi. As manager of the Hunka Bunka Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey, Such booked Jon Bon Jovi & the Wild Ones before joining the singer-songwriter’s band. He played with Bon Jovi through the group’s heyday in the 1980s.
Such left the band in 1994, and was replaced on bass by Hugh McDonald. He later rejoined the band for their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.
“When Jon Bon Jovi called me up and asked me to be in his band many years ago, I soon realised how serious he was and he had a vision that he wanted to bring us to,” Such said at the Hall of Fame induction. “And I am only too happy to have been a part of that vision.”
