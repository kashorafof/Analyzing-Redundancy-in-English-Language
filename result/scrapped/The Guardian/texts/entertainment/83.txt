Got something you’d like to ask the Mission: Impossible and Deep Impact actor? Send it our way and we’ll put it to him
There’s aren’t many actors who can put “hand picked by Tom Cruise” on their CV. Scottish actor Dougray Scott was personally cast by TC to play rogue Impossible Missions Force agent and chief bad guy in 2000’s Mission: Impossible II – famous for that Cruise/Scott motorbike fighting scene. It’s a role that propelled the Twin Town and Deep Impact actor to international fame, even if it did mean he lost the role of Wolverine for 2000’s X-Men (to Hugh Jackman) after filming on MI2 overran. Scott was also apparently in the running to take over Bond in 2006’s Casino Royale, but was pipped to the post by Daniel Craig.
But let’s not worry about all that. This is a safe, happy space where we can quiz the Scot on working with John Malkovich in 2002’s Ripley’s Game; Emilia Fox and Billie Piper in 2005 British caper Things to Do Before You’re 30; and Liam Neeson in 2014’s Taken 3. On the small screen, he has appeared in everything from Taggart and Batwoman to Desperate Housewives and the 2009 BBC adaptation of The Day of the Triffids, and played everyone from Moses to Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde.
Taking his stage name from his grandmother’s surname, Stephen Dougray Scott would very much like to draw your attention to the first ever Kingston international film festival happening in Kingston on Thames this very weekend (24–26 June), to which Scott lends his name as festival ambassador. In return, Scott has kindly offered to answer all your queries on his career, breaking the industry and what he had for breakfast. (Oats, presumably. But which are best? Quaker or Scott’s?) So pop your best question in the comments below by 12 midday on 29 June, and we’ll print his answers in Film & Music and online soon.
 Kingston International film festival runs 24–26 June.
