Many more people injured as thunder and hail lead to flooding, power cuts and flight delays
One woman has been killed and 14 people injured in France as thunder and hailstorms hit the country, ravaging vineyards and delaying flights.
Residents of south-west France posted photos online of hail the size of tennis balls, and drivers in the Paris region shared images of flooded roads and daytime skies blackened by thunder clouds.
Lightning hit the Eiffel Tower, without causing damage, and set roofs on fire east of Paris, according to local authorities.
Thousands of households remained without electricity on Sunday after the storms struck on Saturday, according to the utility company Enedis. Flights out of Orly airport in Paris were temporarily suspended on Saturday, and there were flight delays at Charles de Gaulle.
A woman swept away by flooding was found dead under a car in the Normandy city of Rouen, said the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, in a tweet. The circumstances of the death were unclear.
In the Loire Valley, thousands of young people who were taking part in a scout gathering had to take refuge in the Château de Chambord as hail, thunder and lightning pounded the area. The château director told the public broadcaster France-Info that some children had been treated for signs of hypothermia but no serious injuries had been reported.
Rain also lashed Normandy beaches as veterans and others gathered for the 78th anniversary of D-day, the allied invasion against the Nazis during the second world war.
