A shower of white, brightly burning munitions cascades down on the the Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol in a video released by a pro-Russian separatist commander on Sunday. The video shows projectiles bursting into showers of burning material. Reuters was able to confirm the location, but not the time or date this video was taken. It was posted on the Telegram messaging app by Alexander Khodakovsky, a commander of the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk. 'If you didn't know what it is and for what purpose – you could say that it's even beautiful,' Khodakovsky said in a message accompanying the video
