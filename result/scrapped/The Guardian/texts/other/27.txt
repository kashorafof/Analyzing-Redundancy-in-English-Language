Put a medium-sized pan of water on to boil and find a steamer basket, sieve or colander that will sit neatly in the top.
Cut six medium-to-large courgettes in half lengthways, then into diagonal slices about 4cm in length. Place them in the steamer basket or colander, cover with a lid and let them steam for 8-10 minutes, until they are tender and translucent.
Blitz 80g of fresh white bread to coarse crumbs in a food processor. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan, add the crumbs and let them cook for a few minutes, moving them almost constantly round the pan until they are golden.
Add 1 tsp of dried chilli flakes, 1 tsp of smoked paprika and the finely grated zest of a lemon to the crumbs, stir to mix, then remove from the heat and set aside.
In a small saucepan, warm 250ml of double cream, then add 12 large basil leaves. Add 150g of gorgonzola, broken into pieces and let it melt in the cream.
Put the courgettes in a serving dish, then spoon over the cheese sauce. Scatter over the spiced crumbs and serve. Enough for 2
 You could saut√© the courgettes if you prefer, but I like the contrast between the plain steamed squash and rich cheese sauce.
 Use big, fragrant basil leaves if you can, if not, then you may need a few more to flavour the sauce.
