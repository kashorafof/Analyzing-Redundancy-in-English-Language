When the bombardment of Mariupol became unbearable, Igor Pedin set off with his dog Zhu-Zhu to find safety. Daniel Boffey tells his incredible story

When Igor Pedin set off from Mariupol on 20 April, he had no real idea of how far he would get or the series of adventures that lay ahead of him. He packed as lightly as possible and then took to the road with just his little dog Zhu-Zhu for company.
As Daniel Boffey tells Nosheen Iqbal, the way Igor’s story unfolds from there could barely have been scripted better by a Hollywood writer. The 61-year-old man and his dog traverse the biggest war zone in Europe since 1945. They encounter fierce Russian fighters, negotiate mine-strewn territory, cross a bombed-out bridge, all the while taking their direction from the sun towards relative safety.
The remarkable story has prompted a huge crowdfunding campaign and has now attracted the interest of documentary makers and film studios. It had one simple theme: no matter how tough things got, Igor and Zhu-Zhu carried on and kept walking.
