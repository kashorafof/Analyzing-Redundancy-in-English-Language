Russian forces have destroyed a bridge connecting the embattled city of Sievierodonetsk to its twin city of Lysychansk, cutting off a possible evacuation route for civilians, according to local officials.
Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk province, said on Sunday that the Russian military has destroyed a bridge over the Siverskyi River that linked the two cities. 
He added that Russian shelling in Lysychansk has killed one woman and destroyed four houses and a shopping centre. 
According to the head of the Sievierodonetsk administration, approximately a third of the city remained under the control of Ukrainian forces and about two-thirds were in Russian hands. 
Amnesty International has accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, saying attacks on Kharkiv - many using banned cluster bombs - had killed hundreds of civilians.
The rights group said in a report on Ukraine’s second biggest city published on Monday:
The repeated bombardments of residential neighbourhoods in Kharkiv are indiscriminate attacks which killed and injured hundreds of civilians, and as such constitute war crimes.
This is true both for the strikes carried out using cluster (munitions) as well as those conducted using other types of unguided rockets and unguided artillery shells.
The continued use of such inaccurate explosive weapons in populated civilian areas, in the knowledge that they are repeatedly causing large numbers of civilian casualties, may even amount to directing attacks against the civilian population.”
Amnesty said it had uncovered proof in Kharkiv of the repeated use by Russian forces of 9N210 and 9N235 cluster bombs and scatterable land mines, all of which are banned under international conventions.
Cluster bombs release dozens of bomblets or grenades in mid-air, scattering them indiscriminately over hundreds of square metres (yards).
Scatterable land mines combine “the worst possible attributes of cluster munitions and antipersonnel land mines”, Amnesty said.
Unguided artillery shells have a margin of error of over 100m.
The report, entitled ‘Anyone Can Die At Any Time’, details how Russian forces began targeting civilian areas of Kharkiv on the first day of the invasion on 24 February.
The “relentless” shelling continued for two months, wreaking “wholesale destruction” on the city of 1.5 million.
People have been killed in their homes and in the streets, in playgrounds and in cemeteries, while queueing for humanitarian aid, or shopping for food and medicine,” said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser.
“The repeated use of widely banned cluster munitions is shocking, and a further indication of utter disregard for civilian lives.
“The Russian forces responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.”
Kharkiv’s Military Administration told Amnesty 606 civilians had been killed and 1,248 wounded in the region since the conflict began.
Russia and Ukraine are not parties to the international conventions banning cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines.
But, Amnesty stressed, “international humanitarian law prohibits indiscriminate attacks and the use of weapons that are indiscriminate by nature.
Launching indiscriminate attacks resulting in death or injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects, constitutes war crimes.”

In the meantime, here is a comprehensive run-down of where things stand in Ukraine as of 3.30am.
McDonald’s restaurants have flung open their doors in Moscow under new Russian ownership and a new name, Vkusno & Tochka, which translates to ‘Tasty and that’s it’.
The re-openings took place on Russia Day, a holiday celebrating national pride.
On Sunday, scores of people queued outside what was formerly McDonald’s flagship restaurant in Pushkin Square, central Moscow, according to a Reuters report.
The outlet sported a new logo - a stylised burger with two fries - plus a slogan: “The name changes, love stays”.
Vkusno & tochka’s menu was smaller and did not offer the Big Mac and some other burgers and desserts, such as the McFlurry. A double cheeseburger was going for 129 roubles ($2.31) compared with roughly 160 under McDonald’s and a fish burger for 169 roubles, compared with about 190 previously.
The flagship Moscow restaurant is among 15 rebranded outlets opening in and around the capital on Sunday. Oleg Paroev, CEO of Vkusno & tochka, said the company planned to reopen 200 restaurants in Russia by the end of June and all 850 by the end of the summer.
The chain will keep its old McDonald’s interior but will expunge any references to its former name, said Paroev, who was appointed McDonald’s Russia CEO weeks before the Ukraine conflict began.
“Our goal is that our guests do not notice a difference either in quality or ambience,” Paroev told a news conference in the restaurant.
Global trade ministers gathered to tackle food security threatened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a World Trade Organisation meeting on Sunday.
WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told journalists she was “cautiously optimistic” that the more than 100 attending ministers would manage to agree on at least one or two of a long line of pressing issues, and that would be “a success”.
Top of the agenda at the four-day meeting is the toll Russia’s war in Ukraine, traditionally a breadbasket that feeds hundreds of millions of people, is having on food security.
A number of delegates took the floor to condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine, including Kyiv’s envoy, who was met with a standing ovation, WTO spokesman Dan Pruzin told journalists.
Then, right before Russian Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov spoke, around three dozen delegates “walked out”, he said.
Even before the conference began, the European Union gathered representatives from 57 countries for a show solidarity with Ukraine, with EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis slamming Russia’s “illegal and barbaric aggression”
Ministers are expected to agree on a joint declaration on strengthening food security, in which they will “commit to take concrete steps to facilitate trade and improve the functioning and longterm resilience of global markets for food and agriculture”.
According to the draft text, countries would vow that “particular consideration will be given to the specific needs and circumstances of developing country members”.
The number of nuclear weapons in the world is set to rise in the coming decade after 35 years of decline as global tensions flare amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, researchers say.
The nine nuclear powers - Britain, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, the United States and Russia - had 12,705 nuclear warheads in early 2022, or 375 fewer than in early 2021, according to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
The number has come down from a high of more than 70,000 in 1986, as the US and Russia have gradually reduced their massive arsenals built up during the Cold War.
But this era of disarmament appears to be coming to an end and the risk of a nuclear escalation is now at its highest point in the post-Cold War period, SIPRI researchers said.
Matt Korda, one of the co-authors of the report, told Agence France-Presse:
Soon, we’re going to get to the point where, for the first time since the end of the Cold War, the global number of nuclear weapons in the world could start increasing for the first time.
That is really kind of dangerous territory.”
After a “marginal” decrease seen last year, “nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade”, SIPRI said.
During the war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has on several occasions made reference to the use of nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile several countries, including China and Britain, are either officially or unofficially modernising or ramping up their arsenals, the research institute said.
It’s going to be very difficult to make progress on disarmament over the coming years because of this war, and because of how Putin is talking about his nuclear weapons”, Korda said.
These worrying statements are pushing “a lot of other nuclear armed states to think about their own nuclear strategies”, he added.
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has provided an update following the Russian attack on Ternopil, claiming ten people were injured and are still in hospital.
After the missile strike at the Ternopil region, ten people are still in hospitals. There was no tactical or strategic sense in this strike, as in the vast majority of other Russian strikes. This is terror, just terror.
Among the victims is a 12-year-old girl from Kharkiv. She went to the Ternopil region to flee from the Russian army. And such facts will now determine perception of Russia in the world. Not Peter I or Lev Tolstoy, but children wounded and killed by Russian strikes.”
It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: 
That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock, who will bring you the latest updates. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you.
The British defense company QinetiQ will supply Ukraine with 10 Talon sapper robots for demining purposes, Ukrainian authorities announced on Sunday. 
In a statement on Facebook, the first deputy head of Ukraine’s patrol police, Oleksiy Biloshitsky, said:
Talon will be deployed to demine Ukraine. This is a sapper robot that not only locates ‘gifts’ but also neutralizes them. Before the war we had already had more than a dozen of them, now QinetiQ will deliver 10 more.
According to Ukrainian outlet Ukrinform, approximately 300,000 sq km in Ukraine require demining.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Sunday the possibility of new talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Turkish outlet HaberTurk reports. 
Speaking in regards to snarled exports as a result of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, the outlet cited Erdogan saying: “In fact, we will be in a work to bring this business to a very different dimension, not only to ourselves, but also to send goods to third countries by re-exporting from there.”
“Negotiations continue, and besides these meetings, we also held talks with some relevant people last night. And perhaps in the next week, we will talk about what steps we will take, by holding talks with both Mr Putin and Zelenskiy.”
