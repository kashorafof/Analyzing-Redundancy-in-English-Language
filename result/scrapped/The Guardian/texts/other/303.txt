With Roe v Wade on the brink of defeat, following the leak of a supreme court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito and signed by four other conservative judges, the court’s views – and track record – on abortion are under extreme scrutiny.

Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch were adamant when pressed at their own confirmation hearings that they viewed Roe v Wade as ‘precedent’, with Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett citing the Planned Parenthood v Casey decision in 1992, which reaffirmed the landmark ruling.
