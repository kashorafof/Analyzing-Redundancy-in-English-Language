Britain’s biggest rail strikes in 30 years began on Monday night after last-minute talks failed. The action is being taken by Network Rail employees plus onboard and station staff working for 13 train operators. Up to 40,000 cleaners, signallers, maintenance workers and station staff are due to stop work for three days this week
