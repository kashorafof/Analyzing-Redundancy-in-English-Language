Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly compared his current actions in Ukraine to Peter the Great’s conquest of the Baltic coast during his 18th-century war against Sweden.
After visiting an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great on Thursday, Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs that “you get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn’t taking anything, he was taking it back”, according to a report from Agence France-Presse.
In televised comments, Putin compared Peter’s campaign with Russia’s offensive in Ukraine.
Apparently, it also fell to us to return [what is Russia’s] and strengthen [the country]. And if we proceed from the fact that these basic values form the basis of our existence, we will certainly succeed in solving the tasks that we face.
When Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg and declared it the Russian capital “none of the countries in Europe recognised this territory as belonging to Russia,” Putin added.
Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia’s),”
Everyone considered it to be part of Sweden. But from time immemorial, Slavs had lived there alongside Finno-Ugric peoples.
It is our responsibility also to take back and strengthen.
Yes, there have been times in our country’s history when we have been forced to retreat, but only to regain our strength and move forward.”
The defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700-1721) made Russia the leading power in the Baltic Sea and an important player in European affairs.
But with Russia’s ties with the west currently shattered by the Ukraine invasion, Moscow authorities are downplaying Peter’s affinity for Europe and focusing on his role in expanding Russian territories.
Prior to Putin’s visit to the exhibition, state television aired a documentary praising Peter the Great as a tough military leader, greatly expanding territory at the expense of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire.
More than three centuries after he sought to bring Russia closer to Europe, Russians on Thursday marked the 350th birthday of tsar Peter the Great with the country deeply isolated over the Ukraine conflict.
Peter I reigned first as tsar and then as emperor from 1682 until his death in 1725. 
We will shortly be pausing this live blog before launching more of our live coverage in the next few hours. 
In the meantime, here is a comprehensive run-down of where things stand in Ukraine as of 3.30am.
Ukrainian military casualties are now between 100 and 200 per day, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who spoke with the BBC on Thursday.
Zelenskiy said last week that the Ukrainian army was losing 60 to 100 soldiers a day.
Speaking to entrepreneurs on Thursday, Vladimir Putin compared his invasion of Ukraine with Peter the Great’s invasion of eastern and central Europe in the early 18th century.
Sky News has a quick snippet of some of the footage from the event below.

Ukraine is “holding on” to key frontline cities in Donbas, according to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
Providing a quick update as to the situation in Donbas during his latest national address, Zelenskiy said:
The frontline situation today is without significant changes. Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on. 
We have a certain positive in the Zaporizhzhia region, where we manage to thwart the plans of the occupiers. We are gradually moving forward in the Kharkiv region, liberating our land. We are keeping defence in the Mykolaiv direction.”
That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock, who will bring you the latest updates. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday reported “positive” news from the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, where he said Ukraine’s forces were managing to thwart Russian troops, Agence France-Presse reports. 
In a video address, Zelenskiy also said Ukrainian forces were gradually advancing in the Kharkiv region, east of Kyiv, “liberating our land.”
Senegalese president and African Union chair Macky Sall on Thursday urged Ukraine to demine waters around its Odessa port to ease much needed grain exports from the war-torn country.
Agence France-Presse reports: 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and western sanctions have disrupted grain deliveries from the two countries, fuelling fears of hunger around the world.
Cereal prices in Africa – the world’s poorest continent – have surged because of the slump in exports, sharpening the impact of conflict and climate change and sparking fears of social unrest.
If wheat exports do not resume from Ukraine, Africa “will be in a situation of very serious famine that could destabilise the continent”, Sall told French media outlets France 24 and RFI.
Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the global wheat supply. But grain has remained stuck in Ukraine’s ports due to a Russian blockade, while western sanctions on Moscow have disrupted exports from Russia.
Moscow has called for Ukraine to demine the waters surrounding the Ukrainian-controlled port of Odessa to allow out blocked grain, but Kyiv has refused for fear of a Russian attack.
Sall said Russian president Vladimir Putin, whom he met last week in Russia, had assured him this would not happen.
“I even told him: ‘The Ukrainians said that if they demine, you’ll enter the port.’ He says, no, he will not enter, and that’s a commitment he made,” the Senegalese leader said.
“There must now be work towards getting the demining done, the United Nations involved ... so that we can start getting the Ukrainian wheat out,” he said.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Friday that he had a phone conversation with French president Emmanuel Macron in which “special attention was paid to Ukraine’s path to the EU”.
“We are coordinating steps,” he said. 
Had another phone conversation with 🇫🇷 President @EmmanuelMacron. Informed about the situation on the front. Discussed further defense support for 🇺🇦 and work on security guarantees. Special attention was paid to Ukraine's path to the #EU, we are coordinating steps.
Zelenskiy added that other topics discussed included increased defense support for Ukraine, security guarantees and “the situation on the front”.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed a decree that imposes personal sanctions against 35 high-ranking Russian officials, including Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Other individuals include Russia’s presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu, secretary of the Security Council of Russia Nikolai Patrushev and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, among others. 
Ukrainian troops announced on Thursday that they have advanced in fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk but continued to stress that the only way to fully overcome enemy forces is more weaponry to counter Russia’s advanced firepower.
“They (the Russians) are dying like flies ... fierce fighting continues inside Sievierodonetsk,” Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said in an online post. “The losses of the Russians far exceed ours.” Fighting was now taking place in the towns of Hirske and Popasnyanska, to the south of Sievierodonetsk, he added.
According to the commander of Ukraine’s Svoboda (Freedom) National Guard battalion, the fighting in Sievierodonetsk is being fought house to house as Ukrainian forces face heavy Russian artillery barrages that endanger forces from sides. 
The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its forces had won back some territory from Russian forces in a counter-offensive in the Kherson area of southern Ukraine.
