MINNEAPOLIS — Giancarlo Stanton started in right field Wednesday night, the first time he has played the outfield since coming off the injured list on Saturday.
It was a real adventure for Stanton as he misplayed three balls in the Yankees’ 8-1 loss at Target Field. 
Yankees manager Aaron Boone indicated it was being unfamiliar with the ballpark, but Stanton wasn’t making any excuses. He takes pride in being able to play the outfield and he was embarrassed by being unsure where the wall was as he ran back on a ball and misjudging another he charged in on.
“I was definitely pissed off today,” Stanton said. “I haven’t had a day like that in a long time. If ever.”
Stanton said his ankle, which had him on the IL, was fine.
Stanton had been almost exclusively a DH until last season. The 32-year-old enjoys playing the field and there is some anecdotal evidence that it helps his offense.

Boone explained the thinking process behind putting Stanton back in the outfield before the game.
“We’ve been kind of working through here these last few days and talking about how we want to do it and he keeps checking all the boxes,” Boone said. “With the  off day [on Monday] he wanted to DH that first day [of the three-game series against the Twins]. He got a lot outfield working yesterday and then just got with him postgame last night. And making sure we’re all good for today and for getting him back out there.”
