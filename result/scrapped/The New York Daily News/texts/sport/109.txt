A home in Nebraska made plenty of buzz after thousands of bees were removed from its walls.
The Omaha Bee Club removed about 6,000 of the insects from a 100-year-old house belonging to Thomas and Marylu Gouttierre, who realized something was wrong when they observed many bees outside their kitchen window, the Omaha World-Herald reported.
The couple then found about 30 bees inside a bedroom in the Omaha home.
“Our first thought was should we call an exterminator,” Thomas Gouttierre told the newspaper. 
“But we’ve been reading and there are a lot of great shows on PBS ‘Nature’ about how important bees are to pollinating the world in which we live.”

A hole in the mortar outside the home is believed to be the entry point that allowed the bees to get in. Gouttierre told the World-Herald that “you could hear the buzzing” if you listened closely against the wall.
Two members of the Omaha Bee Club managed to successfully relocate the bees, charging the couple $600. 
One of the club members, Ryan Gilligan, said he removed 15,000 bees from a home during his last job.
