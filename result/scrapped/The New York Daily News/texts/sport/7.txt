The 21-year-old driver was shot in the chest and leg, police said. Medics took him to Kings County Hospital in stable condition.
Shortly after, one of the occupants of the other vehicle, a 25-year-old man, showed up at the same hospital shot in the arm, police said.
Cops have not yet charged either of the wounded men.
