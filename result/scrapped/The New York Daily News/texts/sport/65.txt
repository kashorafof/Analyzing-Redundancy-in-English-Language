A 13-year-old armed with an air rifle during a game of cops and robbers mistakenly shot and killed his 3-year-old cousin in Alabama, according to authorities.
The teen was hiding in his Mobile County home on Wednesday and discovered the weapon stashed inside a closet, WEAR-TV reported. When his young cousin, Weston Spelich, approached him later in the game, the 13-year-old aimed the .22 caliber air rifle and then pulled the trigger.
Mobile County Sheriff’s Office Captain Paul Burch said the 3-year-old was struck in the head with an air pellet, shocking his teen cousin, who did not know the weapon was loaded at the time. The older boy immediately raced off to find help, initially claiming his cousin fell and hit his head.
Weston was transported to a nearby hospital, where doctors later determined he was struck directly above his right eye. He was pronounced dead on Thursday around 4 a.m.
“We don’t let him play like that, like cops and robbers,” Weston’s parents, Mercedes Spelich and James Thomas, told KTVZ. “I don’t let that happen. I would never. Weston knows not to touch stuff like that. He knows mommy and daddy taught him better.”
The teen, who has not been named, was taken to Strickland Youth Center and charged with criminally negligent homicide, which is a misdemeanor. Burch said it is unlikely he will face any charges as an adult.
The captain noted the air soft rifle involved was purchased as gift by the teen’s parents, who were unaware it had that level of power.
