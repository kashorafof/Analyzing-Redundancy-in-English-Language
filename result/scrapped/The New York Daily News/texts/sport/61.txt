He sideswiped a parked Nissan Altima, then rear-ended a parked 2020 Toyota Highlander and was thrown from his bike, cops said. The bike kept going and hit a 2009 Mercedes-Benz driven by a 47-year-old man.
Medics rushed Santana to Lincoln Hospital, but he couldn’t be saved. The Mercedes driver was not hurt.
