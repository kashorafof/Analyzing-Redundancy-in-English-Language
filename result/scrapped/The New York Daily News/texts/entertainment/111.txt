There’s a new superhero for New Jersey to marvel at.
A massive Ms. Marvel cutout now sits atop a billboard along the New Jersey Turnpike to commemorate the release of Marvel Studios’ latest series.
Drivers can look out for the superpowered promotion, which reads “Welcome to New Jersey,” at Exit 14 in Newark.
The cutout arrived ahead of the debut of “Ms. Marvel,” which comes out Wednesday on Disney+ and introduces teenager Kamala Khan as the studio’s first project to center on a Muslim superhero.

Kamala, who is portrayed by Iman Vellani, lives in Jersey City and is obsessed with superheroes — before she obtains cosmic powers and becomes one herself.
Adil El Arbi, who directed the premiere and finale episodes of “Ms. Marvel” with filmmaking partner Bilall Fallah, says they aimed to make Jersey City feel like “a character” on the six-part series.
“I hope that we managed to have a great, cool, urban presence of that city,” El Arbi told the Daily News. “It adds just so much more personality to the show.”

El Arbi and Fallah want Kamala — who originated in the Marvel comic books nearly a decade ago — to become synonymous with Jersey City in the same way fellow superhero Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, is associated with Queens.
“We’re big fans of [director] Spike Lee and the way that he shows New York City as a character. ... ‘Do the Right Thing’ and ‘Clockers.’ That’s a big, big inspiration in our lives,” El Arbi said.
“We said, ‘OK, this has got to be the same way that New York is to Spike Lee. This is what Jersey needs to be to Kamala Khan.’”
