Pop star Lizzo is using her voice to support women’s reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
The “Truth Hurts” singer pledged $500,000 to support Planned Parenthood and abortion rights organizations following last Friday’s ruling, which ended the federal right to get an abortion.
Lizzo said concert promoter Live Nation promised to match with an additional $500,000, bring their joint pledge to $1 million.
“The most important thing is action & loud voices,” Lizzo said in her Instagram announcement. “@plannedparenthood @abortionfunds & organizations like them — will need funding to continue offering services to people who are most harmed by this ban.
“Black women & women of color have historically had disproportionately less access to family planning resources — this is a great loss but not a new one.”

The money will be raised through ticket sales for Lizzo’s upcoming tour, which begins Sept. 23 and runs through Nov. 18, the singer said. The tour includes an Oct. 2 show at Madison Square Garden. 
Rage Against the Machine on Friday vowed to donate the $475,000 that the band had raised from charity ticket sales to support reproductive rights organizations in Wisconsin and Illinois.
“My great grandmother, Mary Maude Fitzgerald, died from an illegal, unsafe abortion,” Tom Morello, the band’s guitarist, tweeted Saturday. 
“Her widower, Thomas Fitzgerald, an itinerant worker, couldn’t raise their 3 kids alone & sent them off to families that took them as servants. He died alone of TB in a work camp.”
