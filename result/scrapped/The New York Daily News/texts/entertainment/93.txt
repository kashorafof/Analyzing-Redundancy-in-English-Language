“Squid Game” has gotten the “green light.”
The hit Netflix survival series about 456 contestants fighting for their lives in a twisted dystopian competition with a $36 million grand prize has officially been renewed for a second season, the streaming service announced Sunday.
“And now, Gi-hun returns. The Front Man returns. Season 2 is coming,” Hwang Dong-hyuk, the director and writer, said in a statement. “The man in the suit with ddakji might be back. You’ll also be introduced to Young-hee’s boyfriend, Cheol-su.”

Netflix, which described the second season as “a whole new round,” did not provide any other details, including a premiere date.
The Korean-language series premiered in September to rave reviews, becoming Netflix’s most-watched series in just 12 days, according to the streaming platform. The show, which featured a giant creepy doll that played a deadly “red light, green light” game, became a global sensation.
The show was nominated for three Golden Globe awards and won one: O Yeong-su for best supporting actor for playing Oh Il-nam, an elderly contestant with a brain tumor. He is the first Korean actor to win a Golden Globe.
