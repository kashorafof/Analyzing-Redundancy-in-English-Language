A parolee charged with attempted murder for grabbing and hurling a woman onto the subway tracks in the Bronx told cops he didn’t mean to do it, prosecutors revealed in court filings Wednesday.
“I didn’t mean to push her onto the tracks. I was drinking. That’s me in the video,” Theodore Ellis, 30, told cops, admitting he shoved the 52-year-old victim at the Jackson Ave.-Westchester Ave. station Sunday afternoon.
The victim was hospitalized with a broken collarbone, a dislocated shoulder and bruise to her head, according to the complaint.
The push was caught on surveillance video released by cops Monday.

A police source told the Daily News that Ellis and the victim had previously argued, but that the suspect couldn’t remember what made him angry “and didn’t realize his own strength when he pushed her.”
Ellis was arrested at the subway station after a station agent recognized his picture on a wanted flyer as someone who often sold MetroCard swipes there.

Ellis was released to parole in January after being sentenced to three to six years behind bars for attempted arson in 2016, public records show.
He’s charged with attempted murder, assault, attempted assault and reckless endangerment.
He was ordered held on $150,000 cash bail or $400,000 bond, and is due back in Bronx Criminal Court Friday.
