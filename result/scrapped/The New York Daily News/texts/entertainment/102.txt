“A Strange Loop,” a bold and profane show from Michael R. Jackson that delivered bracingly honest criticism of the American theater world, reached the pinnacle of the industry on Sunday, winning the Tony Award for best new musical.
The meta musical about a Black gay usher who aspires to write a musical took home the prestigious honor after scoring a field-topping 11 nominations and winning two in a historically diverse season on Broadway.

The introspective 100-minute show, a favorite of critics since it arrived at the Lyceum Theater in April, beat out the hot-selling and musically electrifying “Six” and the Bob Dylan-inspired “Girl from the North Country” to capture the statuette.

The award marks yet another honor for Jackson, 41, who won a Pulitzer for the musical and received Tony nominations for best book of a musical and best original score. He won the best book award.
“I just wanted to write something that to me felt like real life,” Jackson said ahead of the ceremony. “You know, a depiction of a Black gay man’s experience that was very nuanced, complex and real.”
