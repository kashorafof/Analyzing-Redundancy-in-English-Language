Where’s Yeezy?
Apparently basking under the golden arches these days.
Kanye West made a triumphant return to Instagram this week after a brief suspension by teasing his latest business venture.

The billionaire hip-hop superstar, fashion designer and self-proclaimed “greatest artist that God ever created,” posted an image of his upcoming redesign of McDonald’s packaging, which looks like a sandwich that appears to be inside of a clear box with the famous Golden Arches on top.
“Ye teams up with legendary Muji industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa to reimagine McDonald’s packaging,” was written in the caption to his 16 million followers.
The social media post followed a since deleted Instagram Story that the artist also known as Ye shared of the same image with the words: “Next week it’s the fries.”
The line featured on the image is a lyric from his 2005 “Late Registration” megahit “Gold Digger.”

No further information about the redesign has been made public, leaving many to wonder if it’s a permanent or limited-edition change, or if there’s more to the collaboration between the 24-time Grammy Award winner and the fast food chain.
McDonald’s has a long history with music superstars; from Aretha Franklin and Patti LaBelle in the 1980s, to Justin Timberlake in the early aughts.
The burger giant has recently featured acts such as K-pop boy band BTS, sexy rapper Saweetie and reggaeton hitmaker J Balvin in campaigns for curated meal concepts.
Last December, the company partnered with Mariah Carey for a month-long Christmas promotion.
