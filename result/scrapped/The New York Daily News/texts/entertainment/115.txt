With the win, “The Lehman Trilogy” beat out the gripping “Skeleton Crew,” set at a distressed Detroit auto plant during the Great Recession, and the dark and surprising mystery “Hangmen,” about an English executioner who has hung up his noose.

It also topped “The Minutes,” a brisk take on small-town government with a twist ending, and “Clyde’s,” a comedy about ex-convicts working at a sandwich shop.
