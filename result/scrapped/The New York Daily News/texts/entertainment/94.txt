Fox News’ Gianno Caldwell said his younger brother was killed in Chicago on Friday, calling the news “devastating.”
Caldwell didn’t specify how his brother died in an Instagram post Saturday, but a report by Fox News Digital said 18-year-old Christian was fatally shot.
“Yesterday was legitimately the worst day of my existence,” Caldwell wrote on Instagram. “I received a call informing me that my teenage baby brother Christian was murdered on the south side of Chicago yesterday morning.
“After all the things my family has been through never could I have imagined my baby brother’s life would be stolen from him,” Caldwell continued. “Please keep my family in your prayers.”

Caldwell, who says on his Instagram page that he was born in Chicago, included two photos in Saturday’s post showing him with Christian, including one in which the younger sibling was wearing a graduation cap.
Chicago Police confirmed to the Daily News on Sunday that an 18-year-old male was killed in a shooting that also left a 25-year-old woman and 31-year-old man wounded. The woman was said to be in fair condition, while the 31-year-old man was in critical condition.
Police said “an unidentified male offender” fled the scene, and that nobody is in custody as the investigation continues.
Caldwell, who is a political analyst for Fox News, told his outlet that he’s waiting for more information from police, and said he hopes his brother’s killers “turn themselves in.” He also said he wants them to be “rehabilitated.”
“Then one day, whenever they’re out of jail — if it’s not for life — maybe they can turn their lives around and give hope to other young men if there is any hope of rehabilitating them,” Caldwell said.
