The officer’s name was not publicly released by late Saturday. He’s described as an 18-year NYPD veteran assigned to the city’s highway collision investigation squad.
The last NYPD death by suicide was in May, when Officer Sean Armstead fatally shot a young man he suspected was having an affair with his wife, then turned the gun on himself in upstate Orange County.
