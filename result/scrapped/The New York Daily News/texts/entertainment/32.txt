Thieves punched and threw a man to a Manhattan sidewalk during a caught-on-camera mugging, police said Saturday.
The 20-year-old man was on St. Nicholas Ave. near W. 189th St. in Washington Heights about 6:40 p.m. Tuesday when a man sucker punched and shoved him to the ground, police said.
Three other men bum-rushed the victim as he sat on the sidewalk and removed a chain from his neck.

The callous thieves also made off with the man’s glasses before they ran off, cops said.
Medics took the man to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
Police released video of the men in the hopes someone may recognize them.
Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
