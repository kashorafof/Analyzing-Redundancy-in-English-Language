He’s running into trouble.
Football star-turned-senate candidate Herschel Walker said Saturday that he “never denied” having four children.
Walker, 60, has made his 22-year-old son Christian a key figure in his public life, including his Republican campaign to represent Georgia in the Senate. But this week, reports revealed that Walker actually has three other children too, two more sons and a daughter.

“I’ve never denied any of my kids and I love them more than I love anything,” Walker said at a Christian political conference in Nashville. “And they didn’t do anything, which just makes me want to fight harder because I’m tired of people misleading the American people.”
One of Walker’s go-to campaign moves has been criticizing “fatherless households.”
“I want to apologize to the African-American community, because the fatherless home is a major, major problem,” he said in a September 2020 interview on Charlie Kirk’s podcast.
In addition to the hidden children, Walker has falsified reported “law enforcement” experience and lied about graduating from the University of Georgia. Walker famously left school early to play in the USFL.
