The boys will be back in town again.
Amazon Prime Video’s hit superhero series “The Boys” has been renewed for a fourth season, just one week after dropping its third, the streamer announced in a release Friday, citing “record growth.”
“Over the first three days of its third season, the worldwide audience for ‘The Boys’ has grown by +17% from Season 2, and +234% from Season 1″ spanning a comparable post-launch period, the company noted.

The show, based on Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson’s comic of the same name, explores a world in which superheroes on par with invincible celebrities abuse their otherworldly abilities.
“The Boys” first hit the streamer, which Variety noted has since also seen an increase in growth at large, in 2019. The second season dropped in fall 2020.
“From our first conversation with [showrunner] Eric Kripke and the creative team about Season Three of ‘The Boys,’ we knew the show was continuing to get even bolder — an impressive feat considering the wild success of the Emmy-nominated second season,” said Vernon Sanders, head of global television, Amazon Studios.
“We’re thrilled to continue Butcher and the Boys’ fight against Homelander and the Seven, as well as comment on the insane world we’re living in. Also, this is the first time in history that exploding genitalia has led to further success,” said Kripke in a nod to the season three premiere.
Season two earned the show five Emmy nominations, including outstanding drama series and outstanding writing for a drama series (”What I Know”).
Those with a keen eye on the goings-on of the show, which centers on TK, may not be shocked — star Karl Urban said nearly three months ago that he was “shooting ‘The Boys’ through the end of the year” at Variety’s SXSW Studio, according to the outlet.
