Jack and Kristina Wagner, who co-starred on the ABC soap opera, married in 1993 and had two sons together, Harrison and Peter, before divorcing in 2006. Jack, who also starred on “Melrose Place,” has a daughter, Kerry, from a previous relationship.
Just weeks before Harrison’s death, Kristina shared a family photo with her two sons on the steps of their family ranch.
“The prickly beauty of the high desert and a landscape surrounded by national forests always reminded us that there is peace when you are willing to look for it,” she wrote on Instagram. “Oh Ranch, it’s time to part. We’ll miss you so much with our heartwarming memories. We know that there are many opportunities for joy ahead.”
