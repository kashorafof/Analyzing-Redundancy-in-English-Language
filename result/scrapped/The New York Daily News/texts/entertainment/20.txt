CHICKEN WILD RICE SOUP | This chicken wild rice soup can be made in an Instant Pot for a speedy weeknight meal. The chickpeas and wild rice give the creamy soup a boost of nutrients and if you want, you could even leave out the chicken for a vegetarian version. You can make this ahead and freeze for later too — just don’t add in the dairy until you reheat it on the stove. For the Chicken Wild Rice soup recipe, click here.

 Rice is the pantry staple that keeps on giving. It’s one of those groceries you can store for years, and it can help to stretch a meal to fill your belly for cheap. And while it generally plays sidekick for most meals, in some parts of the world like Asia and the Middle East, it’s the star of the show in the most delectable dishes. So why can’t rice always have that treatment? From Instant Pot rice pudding and cheesy casseroles to authentic Indian biryani and creole jambalaya, these dishes will transform that cup of rice into something truly spectacular.
