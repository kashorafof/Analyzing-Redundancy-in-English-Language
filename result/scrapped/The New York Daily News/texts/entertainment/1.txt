Seals was born in Texas in 1941. He first collaborated with Darrell “Dash” Crofts in the 1950s and the two moved to California and worked as a songwriting duo before writing and recording their own hits, like “Summer Breeze” and “Diamond Girl.”
After signing with Warner Bros., they scored a hit with “Summer Breeze” in 1972. The duo disbanded in 1980, but reunited multiple times afterward.
Seals is survived by his wife of 57 years, Ruby Jean, and three children: Joshua, Juliette, and Sutherland.
“My heart just breaks for his wife Ruby and their children,” cousin Brady Seals of the country band Little Texas told Variety. “Please keep them in your prayers. What an incredible legacy he leaves behind.”
