This warrants a rose.
“Bachelor” alum Lauren Bushnell Lane and country star and husband Chris Lane are expecting their second child later this year, the couple confirmed to People Monday — the same week their son Dutton celebrates his first birthday.
“To be quite honest, I’ve never been more shocked in my entire life, because this was very much an unexpected surprise,” Bushnell Lane, 32, told the outlet.

“When we found out, Dutton was almost 8 months old and I didn’t feel anything,” said Bushnell Lane. “I truly had no symptoms. I was actually more so taking a pregnancy test just reconfirm that was not what was going on! And to surprise and to Chris’ surprise, it was very much positive.”
The “Hold You Tonight” singer, 37, agreed that the happy news for the couple, who tied the knot in October 2019, “was very shocking!”
“Wasn’t necessarily the plan, but we’re so thankful that we’re able to have another,” said Bushnell Lane. “We had planned on having at least two kids, so we’re very thankful that it was able to happen for us, even if it wasn’t necessarily on our exact timing.”
Though his family tends to “make a lot of boys,” Lane said that his parents “are dying for a little girl, so we’ll see!
While Bushnell Lane insisted this “never happened,” her husband told People: “If it’s a boy, we agreed that I would get to name him. And if it’s a girl, we agreed that she would get to name her.”
