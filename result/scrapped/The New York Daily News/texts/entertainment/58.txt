The van reportedly ran off the road and then flipped. The crash happened in a desert area near the city of Mulegé on the Baja California Sur peninsula, according to local media reports.
A source close to the production told Variety that the group was going from the city of Santa Rosalía to the local airport.
The series is based on the comic book series “American Jesus” by writer Mark Millar and artist Peter Gross. It features a 12-year-old boy who learns he is the returned Jesus Christ, destined to save humankind, according to a Netflix description.
Filming on the show, which had previously been titled “American Jesus,” reportedly started in Mexico in April.
Redrum, the company running the filming, has temporarily paused production, Deadline reported on Saturday.
