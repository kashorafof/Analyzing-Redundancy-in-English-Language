Scott Disick is on the market again.
The reality show star, who shares three kids with ex-girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian, has split from model girlfriend Rebecca Donaldson just two months after they went public with their relationship, sources close to him told E! News Thursday.
“Although they had a short-lived romance, it was definitely serious,” the insider said of the relationship, saying it ended in recent weeks. “He enjoyed his time with her but realized he is not in a place to seriously date right now.”

Another source told the outlet that the split was made “amicably,” and that, thanks to the urging of Donaldson, 27, the “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star might now “spend some time focusing on himself and finding what makes him happy.”
Disick, 39, according to the initial insider, “wants to be single and live freely.”
The couple made their red carpet debut at the April premiere of “The Kardashians” in Los Angeles, which a source told the outlet, resulted from “being out one night and [having] totally hit it off.”
In response to the recent engagements of exes Sofia Richie and Kardashian, Disick posted on Instagram in late April, “In the 305 just call me good luck chuck.”
The 2007 flick, “Good Luck Chuck,” sees Dane Cook as a man who discovers he’s the last man many women sleep with right before they meet their soulmate.
