The umps at the Tony Awards have made their call: “Take Me Out” was a home run.

The well-reviewed production received some unwanted attention this spring after a theatergoer managed to film one of the play’s stars, Jesse Williams, naked during a performance, and posted the video online.
The award on Sunday brought attention on the fast-paced play back into fair territory.
“Take Me Out” beat out a packed field of contenders in the best play revival category that included “American Buffalo,” “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf,” “How I Learned to Drive” and “Trouble in Mind.”

The original Broadway production of “Take Me Out” crossed home with the best play honor at the 2003 Tony Awards. The revival closed Saturday.

The revival was boosted by an oh-so-cool performance from Williams as Darren Lemming, the ball club’s star, a side-splitting turn from Jesse Tyler Ferguson as the outfielder’s business manager and an intense outing from Michael Oberholtzer as the team’s homophobic flamethrowing closer.
All three earned Tony nominations in the best featured actor in a play category, and Ferguson won.
“If you’re going to lose, lose to Jesse Tyler Ferguson,” Oberholtzer cracked to reporters on Sunday night.
