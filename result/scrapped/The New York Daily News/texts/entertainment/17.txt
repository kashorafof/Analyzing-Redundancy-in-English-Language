The rapper Trouble, an accomplished artist from Atlanta whose big-name collaborators included hip-hop stars Drake, Quavo and Fetty Wap, was fatally shot in Georgia, officials said.
Trouble, 34, whose real name was Mariel Semonte Orr, died of a gunshot wound at a hospital Sunday after authorities with the Rockdale County Sheriff’s Office responded to an apartment complex after 3 a.m., the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

The sheriff’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request from the Daily News for comment Monday, but said in a Facebook announcement that 33-year-old Jamicheal L. Jones is wanted for murder, aggravated assault, home invasion and battery.
Officials say Jones didn’t know the rapper, but knew a woman that Trouble was said to be visiting at the apartment complex, according to the Journal-Constitution.
The rapper’s death was confirmed Sunday by his record label, Def Jam.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the children, loved ones, and fans of Trouble,” the label’s post reads. “A true voice for his city and an inspiration to the community he proudly represented.”
Trouble released his debut album, “Edgewood,” in 2018. The album included the songs “Bring it Back,” which features Drake, “Come Thru,” which features The Weeknd, and “Rider,” which features Quavo and Fetty Wap.
