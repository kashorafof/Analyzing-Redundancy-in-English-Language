Want a shot for your tot?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fully approved COVID vaccines for children ages 6 months to 5 years on Saturday — and health officials in New York will start distributing the vaccine Wednesday. Parents can call (877) VAX-4NYC to make an appointment, though walkups will also be accepted. There is no cost.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots will be rolled out starting Wednesday at 10 different city-run sites across the five boroughs; some locations will not be ready for youngsters until Thursday.
Parents and guardians can also use the city’s COVID-19 Vaccine Finder app to make appointments for their children. Doses are also available through an array of clinics and local doctor’s offices.
Here are the city health department locations:
