A woman who started a fire in a planned abortion clinic in Wyoming was caught on camera by the facility’s surveillance system.
Federal investigators are offering $5,000 for tips that lead to the woman’s arrest. She was seen in the building wearing a hoodie and a mask to conceal her identity. She carried an easily identifiable red gas can.
Police also said they found an accelerant in different locations throughout the building. A witness spotted the fire early on, however, so the building was not consumed by flames.

The women’s health center was scheduled to open in mid-June, but the May 25 fire pushed that timeline back, and now it likely won’t be ready until the end of the year.
By that time, abortion may be illegal in Wyoming because the state is one of 13 with laws that will criminalize abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. A leaked draft opinion authored by conservative justice Samuel Alito suggested that’s likely to happen this summer.
Wyoming only has one operational abortion clinic, about 230 miles west of Casper in Jackson.
“Despite these setbacks, we are undeterred in our mission to give the people of Casper access to comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion care,” clinic founder Julie Burkhart said in a statement.
Some residents in the 60,000-person city, Wyoming’s second-largest, have protested outside the future clinic, but there was no violence immediately preceding the fire, police said.
Burkhart said that future employees and organizers have been harassed via phone calls and emails ahead of the opening. Even commenters on the Facebook post from Casper Police supported the arsonist’s actions.
