The door wasn’t even locked. 
Responding officers waited for a key to a classroom that couldn’t be locked from the inside during the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the state’s public safety director testified Tuesday. In the end, 19 children and two teachers were killed.
Armed police reportedly waited nearly an hour outside the classroom that the gunman was in during the May 24 massacre.
“I have great reasons to believe (the door) was never secured,” Col. Steve McCraw said at a state Senate hearing Tuesday. “How about trying the door and seeing if it’s locked?”

[ Police response to Uvalde school shooting was ‘abject failure,’ Texas public safety director testifies ]
The criticism was one of many made by McCraw, who testified that the police response to the shooting at Robb Elementary School was an “abject failure” that “set our profession back a decade.”
He said Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo prioritized the safety of officers over that of the students.
