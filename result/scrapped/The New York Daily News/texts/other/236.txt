An Australian newspaper denied outing actress Rebel Wilson after giving her two days to comment on her new relationship with designer Ramona Agruma.
The Sydney Morning Herald garnered backlash over the weekend when columnist Andrew Hornery wrote that Wilson shared a public Instagram post about the romance after his newspaper asked for comment about it. Wilson posted on social media before the paper could publish the story. 
It’s believed to be Wilson’s first publicly known same-sex relationship.
On Sunday, the Sydney Morning Herald editor Bevan Shields addressed the controversy.
“Our weekly Private Sydney celebrity column last week asked Wilson if she wished to comment about her new partner. We would have asked the same questions had Wilson’s new partner been a man,” Shields wrote on the newspaper’s website. “To say that the Herald ‘outed’ Wilson is wrong.”

The Australian-born Wilson, who starred in the “Pitch Perfect” movies, posted a photo with Agruma last Thursday.
“I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess,” Wilson captioned the post.
Hornery then shared his account on Saturday, claiming that after the newspaper reached out to Wilson’s representatives, the actress “opted to gazump the story.”
Wilson has not commented on either of the Sydney Morning Herald’s claims.
