The first primary for Assembly and statewide offices — including races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, and U.S. Senate.
Who are the candidates for governor?
New Yorkers registered with either the Republican or Democratic parties can head to the polls in the coming days to pick their preferred candidates for statewide races, Assembly contests, judges and other local elected positions including district leaders. Voters must have registered with a party in-person or online before June 3 to be eligible.
The deadline to request an absentee ballot, however, has already passed. Voters who applied for an absentee but decide to vote in person must complete an affidavit ballot if they show up at a polling site, a change from past years.
If you are registered to vote and provided ID when you registered, you do not need to show any documentation when you go to vote. If you did not provide ID when you first registered, you can still vote using an affidavit ballot at a polling location.
Those heading to the polls don’t have to worry about putting candidates in order of preference since ranked-choice voting only applies to local city elections.
