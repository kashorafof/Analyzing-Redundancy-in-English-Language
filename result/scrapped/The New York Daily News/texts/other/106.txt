A soldier based out of Washington state’s Joint Base Lewis McChord was fatally shot at a house party over the weekend.
U.S. Army Sgt. Emmett Leviticus Moore, 22, was hanging out with friends in Parkland Saturday evening when gunfire broke out, according to the Pierce County Sheriff’s Office.
Responding police attempted first aid and CPR but were unsuccessful in saving Moore.
“It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of Sgt. Moore.” Lt. Col. John C. Tisserand, 1-14 CAV Battalion Commander, said in a statement.
“This is an extremely difficult time for the Warhorse family. Our primary mission now is taking care of the family members of our fallen soldier. We also respectfully request privacy for Sgt. Moore’s family as they navigate thought this difficult time.”
The suspect, who was allegedly at the party as well, fled the scene.
A spokesperson for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Office told the Daily News Monday that no arrests have been made yet.
