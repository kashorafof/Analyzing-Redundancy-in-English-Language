A government attorney for the Philippines was shot and killed inside his Uber Saturday while on vacation with his mother in Philadelphia.
John Albert Laylo, 35, and his mother were in the ride share on their way back to Philadelphia International around 4 a.m. Saturday when someone in a black car fired several rounds into their car while it was stopped at a red light near the University of Pennsylvania, according to the Philadelphia Police Department.
Laylo was rushed to Penn Presbyterian Hospital and placed on life support. He was pronounced dead just after 10:30 a.m. Sunday.
“Before he left he made sure we had fun! But never did I imagine or dream that its almost the end of our vacation will be like this! We traveled together and we are supposed to go home together! I will bring him home soon in a box!” Laylo’s mother, Leah Bustamante, wrote on Facebook.
“My son has a lot of dreams a lot of plans, hopes and everything! He’s gone now. I can’t explain the pain the heaviness I have in my heart. It took me hours to post this because still I can’t believe this happened!”

Police told CBS 3 that early signs point to a random shooting, possibly a road rage incident.
A spokesperson for the Philadelphia Police Department did not immediately return a request for comment from the Daily News Monday morning.
Philippine Consul General Elmer Cato said Monday that he assured Laylo’s mother that the government “will do everything we can to bring him home as soon as possible.”
