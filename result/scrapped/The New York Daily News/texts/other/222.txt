Starbucks believes that chocolate is what’s been missing from your iced coffee.
The java chain debuted Chocolate Cream Cold Brew on Tuesday as part of its new summer lineup, which also includes the launch of a Lime-Frosted Coconut Bar.
The new cold brew combination is topped with “a light, sweet and silky chocolate cream cold-foam, and is sweetened with vanilla syrup,” according to the company.
There are also notes of malt flavor in the chocolate cream cold foam.
The summer sip is available now at Starbucks stores across the country, as are the rest of the seasonal menu items.

Patrons opting for the Lime-Frosted Coconut Bar will get a bite full of chewy coconut, oatmeal and mini white chocolate chips, topped with lime frosting, a drizzle of white icing and a bit of coconut shavings.
Fan-favorites making their return this summer are the Unicorn Cake Pop, available for a limited time, and the Bacon, Sausage & Egg Wrap, joining the permanent menu.
The Seattle-based roastery’s summer lineup announcement came on the same day that “Succession” actor James Cromwell glued his hand to a counter at a Midtown Manhattan Starbucks to protest the chain charging extra for non-dairy milk.
The PETA-backed protest happened at a Broadway Starbucks near W. 40th St. The chain charges up to 70 cents extra for a plant-based milk addition to coffee. While the upcharge was slashed at UK locations, it’s still in effect in the U.S.
