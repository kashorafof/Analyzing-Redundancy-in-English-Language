A riled-up moose charged and injured two people and their dog Wednesday morning west of Denver, police said.
The female moose, known as a cow moose, seriously injured a 31-year-old man, the Boulder County sheriff’s office said. A woman who was with the man suffered minor injuries, and their dog was also hurt in the attack near Nederland, about 30 miles northwest of Denver..
A cop arrived on the scene and used beanbag rounds to scare the moose away, according to police. However, the moose came back, forcing the officer to fire another warning shot.
But that wasn’t enough, as the moose returned a third time while a medical team was evacuating the injured hikers, cops said. With the moose continuing to charge at people, a Boulder County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot the moose.

The Colorado wildlife department will investigate the incident. Police did not provide the man’s condition or identify any of the parties..
It’s the third moose attack in Colorado this year, following a May 26 attack in Breckenridge and a May 31 incident in Grand Lake. In both cases, a cow moose was defending its children.
Moose have been known to mistake dogs for wolves and go on the attack. In a 2015 incident near Denver, a dog distracted a moose to save a family.
