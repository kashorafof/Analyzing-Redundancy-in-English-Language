An American Airlines flight was evacuated Monday morning after a mysterious odor was reported in the cabin.
The flight, set to take off for Melbourne, Fla., was taxiing at Charlotte’s Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, with 60 passengers and four crew members aboard when the odor drew suspicion and smoke began filling the cabin.

“Shortly after 9:30 a.m. ET, American Eagle Flight 5594 operated by PSA Airlines, halted takeoff from Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) due to reports of a potential odor in the cabin,” the airline said in a statement. “The aircraft stopped safely on the taxiway where customers were asked to deplane through boarding doors onto the ramp. Buses were used to transport customers back to the terminal where they are expected to board another aircraft for continuing service to Melbourne, Florida (MLB).”
Passengers were evacuated via a ramp back onto the tarmac and taken back to the terminal. Around noon, they were seen boarding a new plane, according to WSOC-TV.
The station also reported that the same plane had an electrical issue that caused smoke and a strange smell twice in 2021.
