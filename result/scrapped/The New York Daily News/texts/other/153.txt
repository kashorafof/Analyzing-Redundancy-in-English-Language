The California man who allegedly held his roommate hostage for six months and tortured her previously worked in two different police departments.
Peter McGuire, 59, was arrested earlier this month after his alleged 22-year-old victim escaped his Chino Hills home and was taken to the police by bystanders.
“Very soon after moving into the house she was not allowed to leave, she was held there against her will by him and at that point was subjected to multiple assaults,” the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement.

According to a criminal complaint, McGuire “subjected” her to multiple assaults, including cutting out her tongue, putting out an eye and slitting her nose, ear and lip.
“The victim had visible injuries consistent with the allegations made,” officials said in a statement.
From 1986 to 1987, McGuire worked for the Huntington Park Police Department, then for the now defunct Hawaiian Gardens Police Department from 1995 to 1997, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office confirmed to the Daily News Thursday.
He pleaded not guilty last week to kidnapping, torture, mayhem, rape, false imprisonment, sodomy, forcible oral copulation and assault with a deadly weapon.
