An Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet was killed in a Humvee accident while training in Idaho, officials said Sunday.
MacKenzie Wilson, a 19-year-old cadet from Oregon State University, was training out of Saylor Creek Range, part of the Mountain Home Range Complex, Friday when she was hurt in the accident, the Air Force announced.
Other cadets attempted life-saving actions until first responders arrived but Wilson was pronounced dead at the scene.
Two other people in the Humvee were hospitalized and have since been released.

The Air Force did not provide any details about the cause of the accident.
“Today we lost a member of our Air Force family. We express our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of all the individuals,” Col. Ernesto DiVittorio, 366th Fighter Wing commander, said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with them.”
Nineteen ROTC cadets were at the base for Operation Air Force, “an immersive professional development training opportunity to expose cadets to a variety of different mission sets,” according to officials.
