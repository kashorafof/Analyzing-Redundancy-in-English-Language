Police in Gary, Indiana, are seeking suspects in a nightclub shooting that occurred early Sunday and left two dead and four others wounded, one of them critically.

The shots were reported at around 2 a.m. at a nightclub in Gary, Indiana. Responding police found two people unresponsive, a 34-year-old man near the nightclub entrance and a 26-year-old woman, both of whom were declared dead at a local hospital.
No information on victims or motive was released, The Associated Press reported. Several agencies responded because the club was full of people who had to be evacuated.
It was among at least half a dozen mass shootings nationwide since Friday night, ABC News reported, and the fourth straight weekend in which police have responded to multiple incidents with four or more people shot.
Besides Gary, the weekend saw mass-casualty shootings in New Orleans, Detroit, Louisville, Kentucky; Decatur, Georgia; Antioch, Tenn., and Chicago, the latter for the third straight weekend, ABC News said. There have been more than 63 mass shootings across the U.S. — two per day on average — since a racially motivated gunman unleashed terror on a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket on May 14, according to ABC News.
