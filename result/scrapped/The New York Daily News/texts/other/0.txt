Police in Manchester, N.H., cleared out the area where the Queen City Pride festival is taking place Saturday after reports of a “suspicious vehicle” in the area, organizers said.
The area around Arms Park was evacuated early Saturday morning, as vendors were setting up their tents and booths for the festival, which was scheduled to open at noon.
Local media reported that an unoccupied truck with no distinguishable markings was found in the parking lot, triggering an investigation.
Manchester police, as well as members of the New Hampshire State Police Bomb Squad, arrived at the scene just before 9 a.m. to clear out the area.
“Out of an abundance of caution the Manchester Police Department is doing their due diligence to inspect a suspicious vehicle on the festival grounds,” organizers said in a statement, adding that the parade would be delayed for a “short period of time.”
Officers in protective gear moved people to a safer area, before approaching the truck to investigate. Once the vehicle was deemed safe, it was removed by a towing truck.
According to local news site Patch, Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg said that investigators became suspicious of the vehicle police because of where it was parked and because of the number of participants expected at the event.
Organizers say that more than 5,000 people are expected to attend this year’s event.
The park has since reopened to the public, and the parade was delayed for about two hours.
