A man who allegedly posed for a selfie wearing the glasses of one of his murder victims is being held on $1 million bail.
Travis Lamar Birkley, 34, has been charged with six counts of felony murder as a result of an armed robbery more than four months after six bodies were found inside a northwest Milwaukee home, according to WISN.
Police found Charles Hardy, Caleb Jordan and Javoni Liddel dead from gunshot wounds to the head in the basement on Jan. 23 after two women upstairs told them there were “bodies down there,” according to Birkley’s arrest affidavit.
During a sweep of the house, officers also found Donta Williams and his wife Michelle dead upstairs and a sixth victim, Donald Smith, dead under a pile of clothing in the second-floor bedroom.

Police identified Birkley as a suspect based on cell phone locations, but also on a selfie taken in what appears to be the basement, wearing what appear to be Donta Williams’ glasses.
A witness told police that Birkley confessed to the murders, calling it a “robbery gone bad,” according to the arrest affidavit.
A judge set Birkley’s bail at $1 million Sunday. He is due back in court on June 15 for a preliminary hearing.
If convicted, Birkley faces up to 330 years in prison.
