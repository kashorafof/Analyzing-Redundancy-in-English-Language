A North Carolina mother who lost two sons to car accidents was fatally mauled early Thursday by one of the two pit bulls she was dog-sitting.
Trena Peed, 46, was heard screaming for help at around 2 a.m. just after letting the dogs out into her Greensboro backyard, while her son was sleeping inside, WGHP reports.
“Early this morning, my mom was tragically taken away from us by a vicious attack from a dog,” Peed’s daughter, Waynesha Peed, wrote in a GoFundMe meant to raise money for Peed’s funeral. “My mom has always been a true example of strength, love, and determination.”
Trena Peed was just 46. 
The younger Peed noted that her “siblings, grandmother, family, & I are heartbroken.
“She has endured and overcame so much, most recently losing two of her sons 2. years apart, both by tragic car accidents,” she continued. “By her faith, she always had a smile on her face that could light up any room, loved to laugh, cook, enjoy life & had a heart of gold.”
The family, she said, is hoping to bury her mother in her home state of Virginia.
“All I know is that they... they done drug her into the dark,” said one 911 caller, according to the outlet.
Greensboro Police told the outlet they could only stop the animals after shooting one, while Guilford County Animal Services has the other in quarantine, according to WGHP.
Greensboro Police did not immediately respond to the Daily News’ request for comment regarding potential charges against the dogs’ owners.
