One of the two teachers killed in the Texas school shooting desperately called her husband, a police officer, for help after she was shot.
Ruben Ruiz stormed into the hallway at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde determined to save his wife, Eva Mireles. But he was stopped by other officers, detained and had his gun taken away.
Mireles, her co-teacher Irma Garcia and 19 of their fourth-grade students were killed by 18-year-old Salvador Ramos in the May 24 massacre.
Eva Mireles was killed May 24 while teaching at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. 
Texas Department of Public Safety director Steve McCraw detailed the cowardice of police officers at the scene during a Tuesday hearing in front of the Texas Senate. He relayed the unfathomable story of Ruiz and Mireles during his testimony.
“We’ve got an officer, Officer Ruiz, whose wife called him and said she had been shot and she was dying,” McCraw said. “And what happened to him, is he tried to move forward into the hallway. He was detained, and they took his gun away from him and escorted him off the scene.”
McCraw did not say who exactly took Ruiz’s gun, but he had choice words for Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo.
“The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from entering Room 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,” he said.
McCraw described the police response as an “abject failure” that “set our profession back a decade.”
“I don’t care if you have on flip-flops and Bermuda shorts, you go in,” McCraw continued. “You have one officer, that’s enough.”
