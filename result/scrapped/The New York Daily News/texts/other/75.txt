Country singer Toby Keith was diagnosed with stomach cancer last fall, he announced Sunday.
“I’ve spent the last 6 months receiving chemo, radiation and surgery. So far, so good. I need time to breathe, recover and relax,” he said in a statement on Instagram.
“I am looking forward to spending this time with my family. But I will see the fans sooner than later. I can’t wait.”
The 60-year-old Oklahoma native has been one of the most popular country singers since the ‘90s, putting out 19 studio albums, two Christmas albums and five compilation albums across a celebrated career.

In January 2021, a week before the attempted coup at the Capitol, former president Donald Trump presented a National Medal of the Arts to Keith, who performed at the pre-Inaugural “Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration.”
The Toby Keith Foundation, founded in 2006, aims to help children fighting pediatric cancer and opened the OK Kids Korral in 2014 to provide “a cost-free, convenient and comfortable home for pediatric cancer patients receiving treatment” at nearby Oklahoma hospitals and treatment centers.
