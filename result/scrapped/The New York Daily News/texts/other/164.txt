The man who is suspected of fatally shooting a former Wisconsin judge has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Douglas K. Uhde, 56, reportedly created a hit list of politicians and allegedly shot former Juneau County Circuit Court judge John Roemer, 68, on Friday.
Uhde was found in Roemer’s home in New Lisbon, Wis., in the basement Friday morning after police arrived at the scene following reports of gunshots and an armed man in the house.
Police unsuccessfully negotiated with Uhde for several hours. After police breached the home, Roemer was found dead and bound to a chair with zip ties. Uhde was found critically wounded and taken to a nearby hospital.

Uhde was declared legally brain dead on Saturday and taken off life support on Tuesday, the Wisconsin Department of Justice said.
“Today, Juneau County Medical Examiner notified DCI that Uhde was declared deceased. He was declared legally brain-dead on June 4, 2022, at 9:41 a.m. His body remained on life-support until today to allow for organ donation,” the agency said.
Roemer had previously sentenced Uhde to six years in prison in 2005 on a charge of armed burglary with a dangerous weapon.
State attorney general Josh Kaul said the suspect had a list of other targets, but did not identify them. According to The Daily Beast, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were on the list.
Kaul said all the people on the list have been informed.
“It appears to be related to the judicial system,” Kaul said. “At this point, we are not aware of any evidence indicating that there is any active danger to other individuals. Those who may have been other targets have been notified of that.”
