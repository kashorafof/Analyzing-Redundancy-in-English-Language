An Alabama woman with a large following on TikTok says her 18-year-old son was fatally shot last week.
Ophelia Nichols urged her millions of followers for information as she choked back tears in a video addressing son Randon Lee’s death.
“There’s almost 7 million people that follow me,” Nichols, who is known as Mama Tot, said in the video Saturday. “Somebody’s got to know something.”
Lee suffered the fatal gunshot wound at a gas station in Mobile on Friday, according to local news station WALA.
Nichols, whose TikTok username is shoelover99, said that Saturday would have been her son’s 19th birthday.

“My son was murdered,” Nichols, who currently has more than 7.3 million followers, said in the TikTok video. “He was shot, and I have this hatred in my heart that I don’t recognize because I’ve never felt hate for anybody.
“This individual took my son’s life,” she continued. “He was just 18 years old. That’s the best part of somebody’s life. And I know they’re out there in my town. They’re out there. They’re out there living and breathing when my son is dead.”
In an update to the post Sunday, Nichols wrote that there is “a lead on 2 individuals. I hope they see this video & know what they have done to my family.”
