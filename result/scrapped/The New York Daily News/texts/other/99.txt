A school resource officer shot and killed a man “aggressively” attempting to enter a Georgia elementary school, according to authorities.
A concerned citizen called 911 around 9:30 a.m. Thursday, after they spotted a man trying to get inside Walnut Park Elementary School as well as several cars in the parking lot. Police in turn notified a security guard at the school in Gadsden, who is a Rainbow City police officer, according to WVTM.
The school resource officer initially attempted to initiate a conversation with the man, but the confrontation quickly turned violent. Etowah County Sheriff Jonathan Horton said the suspect, identified as 32-year-old Robert White from North Carolina, was fatally struck amid the scuffle, after he attempted to snatch the officer’s gun.

The officer, who was not identified, was also injured and taken to the hospital for treatment.
Gadsden City Schools Superintendent Tony Reddick told ABC 33/40 that White tried several doors as he tried to enter the building. He added that all the doors were secure and that the school was put into lockdown amid the incident.
Further backup was also called to assist at the scene.

“We put a lot into our schools in this county, and you hate to see anyone lose their life, but that’s what happens when people try to do things to hurt our kids,” Horton told the news station. “At least it ended in the front yard and everybody, the staff, and students are safe. The officers are safe.”
The incident remains under investigation by the The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.
