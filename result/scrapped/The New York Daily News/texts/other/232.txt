The 26-year-old man accused of threatening to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh outside his Maryland home has been indicted by a federal grand jury.
Nicholas Roske has been charged with one count of attempting to murder a justice of the United States, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday night.

The indictment also seeks the forfeiture of a firearm, two magazines each loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition, 17 rounds of ammunition in a plastic bag and other items that police believe Roske planned to use in his assassination attempt.
Just before 1 a.m. on June 8, Roske, dressed all in black and wielding a suitcase and a backpack, got out of a cab near Kavanaugh’s Chevy Chase home and crossed paths with two deputy U.S. marshals stationed outside, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Daily News.
Rather than face the marshals, Roske allegedly walked away and called 911, telling the operator that he was having suicidal thoughts, had a gun in his bag and had come to kill a justice, without identifying Kavanaugh by name, prosecutors said.

Montgomery County police found a black tactical chest rig, a Glock 17 pistol with two magazines, ammunition, a knife, pepper spray, zip ties and duct tape inside his backpack when they arrested him.
Roske allegedly told detectives that he was “upset” about the Supreme Court’s expected decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and believed that Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun-control laws despite the recent mass shootings.
If convicted on the federal charge, Roske faces up to life in prison.
