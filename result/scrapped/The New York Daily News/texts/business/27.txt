This weekend, the ultimate guardians of the New York State Constitution, the seven judges of the Court of Appeals, are considering the Assembly district lines that court after court have found violate the Constitution. As plenty of time remains for new maps and a legitimate primary election in August or September, that must be the answer of Chief Judge Janet DiFiore and her court.
While the high court has moved with the appropriate lightning speed on these cases of paramount importance on the constitutionality of the formation of our government, as witness this weekend briefing schedule, the courts below have dallied.

Immediately after DiFiore invalidated congressional and Senate districts, the Assembly maps were challenged in Steuben County Court. But that judge waited nine days to hear the matter, then suggested that a new case be commenced. A Manhattan petition was filed, but wasn’t heard for eight days. Then the appellate argument wait was another 13 days, producing the unanimous decision against the Assembly maps.
That’s 30 days of delays. Unconscionable. Void the maps and order new ones this year.
