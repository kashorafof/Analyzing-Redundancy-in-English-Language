The bodies of two Canadians, including a man wanted internationally for fraud, were found with their throats slit inside an apartment in the Mexican resort city of Playa del Carmen, officials said.
A security guard was also injured in connection with the double slaying, according to a press release issued by the state prosecutor’s office on Monday.
None of those involved have been identified.
A search of the tourist apartment complex where the violence unfolded — located in the heart of Playa del Carmen — turned up identification for one of the victims. Authorities said he was a fugitive and that he had IDs with three different names.
It’s not yet clear whether the murdered pair were tourists or had been living in the area, though investigators believe they’ve been in the resort city for at least a few months, AFP reported.

Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department issued a warning, urging “extreme caution” when traveling to the area of Quintana Roo — which includes Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum — citing criminal activity, violence and kidnapping. Despite the dangers, the region’s proximity to the Caribbean Sea has made the spot popular with visitors and tourists. 
“Travelers should maintain a high level of situational awareness, avoid areas where illicit activities occur, and promptly depart from potentially dangerous situations,” it reads.
“While not directed at tourists, shootings between rival gangs have killed or injured innocent bystanders. Additionally, U.S. citizens have been the victims of both non-violent and violent crimes in tourist and non-tourist areas.”
In a separate case, two Canadians were killed and a third injured during a January shootout at a resort near Cancun.  And in March, a British resident of Playa del Carmen was shot and killed in broad daylight during a drive with his daughter.
