More than two years after the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, Minneapolis is hiring a new police chief.
The job is described as a “rare and incredible opportunity to lead a police agency in a major U.S. city eager to make comprehensive and positive changes that build community trust and ensure public safety,” according to ABC News.

Amelia Huffman has been serving as the interim police chief since Medaria Arradondo retired early in 2022.
The news of the job posting comes days after the city council voted to increase the police chief’s salary to somewhere between $253,000 and $300,000.
Floyd was killed by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin who has been convicted of both murder charges and civil rights violations.
One other officer, Thomas Lane, has been convicted of federal civil rights violations and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Two other officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were also convicted of civil rights violations and are awaiting trial for aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
The Justice Department is also conducting an investigation into potential civil rights violations by the police department at large.
