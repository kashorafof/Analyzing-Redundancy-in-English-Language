ATLANTA — Georgia Republicans chose their nominees in two heavily GOP districts in Tuesday runoffs, both times rejecting candidates backed by former President Donald Trump.
In the 10th Congressional District east of Atlanta, trucking company owner Mike Collins beat former Democrat Vernon Jones in a runoff to become the Republican nominee. 
In the 6th District in Atlanta’s northern suburbs, emergency room physician Rich McCormick held off lawyer Jake Evans. That race had revolved around accusations by each candidate that the other was insufficiently conservative.
The former president had endorsed both Mr. Jones and Mr. Evans, continuing his losing streak in a state whose Republican officials had been among the biggest targets of his wrath regarding his claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
The 6th and the 10th are both heavily Republican districts.
In southwest Georgia’s 2nd District, Republicans have high hopes of knocking off 30-year Democratic incumbent Sanford Bishop. The GOP was choosing between former Army officer Jeremy Hunt and real estate developer Chris West in that race.
