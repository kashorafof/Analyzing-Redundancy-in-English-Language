MIAMI — Jazz Chisholm Jr. homered twice, including a grand slam, and had a career-high six RBIs as the Miami Marlins beat the Washington Nationals 12-2 on Tuesday night.
Nick Fortes and Jorge Soler also went deep while Avisaíl García had three hits for the Marlins.
Rookie right-hander Edward Cabrera allowed one run in six innings. In his second start since being promoted from Triple-A last week, Cabrera (2-0) limited Washington to two hits, walked two, struck out four and hit a batter.
The Marlins have scored 26 times in Cabrera’s first two outings. They beat Colorado 14-1 on June 1.
Chisholm snapped a 2-for-29 skid with his second-inning grand slam. He drove a 3-0 pitch off Joan Adon (1-10) over the wall in center to make it 5-0.
Homers from Fortes and Soler keyed another five-run inning in the fourth.
Fortes’ three-run blast ended Adon’s outing after three-plus innings. Andrés Machado relieved Adon and allowed Garrett Cooper’s one-out double and Soler’s two-run shot.
Chisholm hit his 10th homer of the season in the fifth, a two-run shot off Machado. It was the second multi-homer game of Chisholm’s career.
Cabrera’s string of 11 scoreless innings since being called up ended on Luis García’s solo homer in the sixth.
Adon allowed eight runs on seven hits and two walks. The right-hander became the first major league pitcher with double-digit losses this season.
