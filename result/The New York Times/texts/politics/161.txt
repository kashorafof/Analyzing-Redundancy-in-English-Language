KHERSON REGION, Ukraine — Since Russia invaded, NATO nations have upgraded Ukraine’s arsenal with increasingly sophisticated tools, with more promised, like the advanced multiple-launch rocket systems pledged by the United States and Britain.
But training soldiers how to use the equipment has become a significant and growing obstacle — one encountered daily by Junior Sgt. Dmytro Pysanka and his crew, operating an aged antitank gun camouflaged in netting and green underbrush in southern Ukraine.
Peering through the sight attached to the gun, Sergeant Pysanka is greeted with a kaleidoscope of numbers and lines that, if read correctly, should give him the calculations needed to fire at Russian forces. However, errors are common in the chaos of battle. 
More than a month ago, the commanders of his frontline artillery unit secured a far more advanced tool: a high-tech, Western-supplied laser range finder to help with targeting.
But there’s a hitch: Nobody knows how to use it.
“It’s like being given an iPhone 13 and only being able to make phone calls,” said Sergeant Pysanka, clearly exasperated.
The range finder, called a JIM LR, is like a pair of high-tech binoculars and likely part of the tranche of equipment supplied by the United States, said Sergeant Pysanka.
It may seem like a perfect choice to help make better use of the antitank gun, built in 1985. It can see targets at night and transmit their distance, compass heading and GPS coordinates. Some soldiers learned enough to operate the tool, but then rotated elsewhere in recent days, leaving the unit with an expensive paperweight.
“I have been trying to learn how to use it by reading the manual in English and using Google Translate to understand it,” Sergeant Pysanka said.
On Monday, Britain promised to send Ukraine mobile multiple-rocket launchers, improving the range and accuracy of Ukrainian artillery, days after President Biden committed to sending similar weapons.
Ukraine’s most advanced new arms are concentrated in the eastern Donbas region, where the fiercest fighting rages as President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces — approaching from the east, north and south — try to crush a pocket of Ukrainian-held territory. At the eastern tip of that pocket, the two sides have waged a seesaw battle for the devastated, mostly abandoned city of Sievierodonetsk.
Over the weekend, Ukrainian troops regained some ground in the city, according to Western analysts and Ukrainian officials. But on Monday, the Ukrainians were forced back again as the Russian military ramped up its already intense artillery attack, according to Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s administrator for the region.
A day after a risky visit to troops in Lysychansk, near Sievierodonetsk, President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday gave journalists a blunt assessment of the challenge: “There are more of them. They are more powerful. But we have every chance to fight in this direction.”
Ukraine’s leaders frequently call for high-end Western weapons and equipment, pinning their hopes for victory to requests for new antitank guided missiles, howitzers and satellite-guided rockets.
But atop the need for the tools of war, Ukrainian troops need to know how to use them. Without proper training, the same dilemma facing Sergeant Pysanka’s unit and their lone range finder will be pervasive on a much larger scale. Analysts say that could echo the United States’ failed approach of supplying the Afghan military with equipment that couldn’t be maintained absent massive logistical support.
“Ukrainians are eager to employ Western equipment, but it requires training to maintain,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va. “Some things it’s not easy to rush.”
The United States and other NATO countries gave extensive training to the Ukrainian military in the years before the war, though not on some of the advanced weapons they are now sending. From 2015 to early this year, U.S. military officials say, American instructors trained more than 27,000 Ukrainian soldiers at the Yavoriv Combat Training Center near Lviv. There were more than 150 American military advisers in Ukraine when Russia invaded in February, but they were withdrawn. 
Since the beginning of the war, the United States has pledged roughly $54 billion in aid for Ukraine and supplied a bevy of weapons and equipment, most recently several advanced HIMARS mobile rocket launchers, a move greeted with swift condemnation from the Kremlin.
But to avoid a more direct confrontation with Russia, the Biden administration has so far declined to send military advisers back into Ukraine to help train Ukrainian forces to use new weapons systems, and has instead relied on training programs outside the country.
This has put enormous pressure on Ukrainian soldiers like Sgt. Andriy Mykyta, a member of the country’s border guard who, before the war, received brief training from NATO advisers on the advanced British antitank weapons, known as NLAWs.
Now he races around frontline positions trying to educate his comrades on how to use them. In many cases, he said, Ukrainian soldiers learned how to use some weapons, including NLAWs, on their own, using online videos and practice.
“But there are types of weapons that you can’t learn from intuition: surface-to-air missiles, artillery and some gear,” Sergeant Mykyta said in a telephone interview. “So we need formal courses,” he added.
Ukraine’s needs are palpable in the region where Sergeant Pysanka’s unit is dug in, just northeast of the Russian-occupied city of Kherson. The area was the site of a brief Ukrainian offensive in the past week that slowed as soon as the retreating Russians destroyed a key bridge; the Ukrainians’ lack of longer-range artillery meant they were unable to attempt a difficult river crossing in pursuit, Ukrainian military officials said.
For Sergeant Pysanka’s gun team, the only instructor available for the laser range finder is a soldier who remained behind from the last unit and had taken time to translate most of the 104-page instruction manual. But it’s still trial and error as they figure out what combination of buttons do what, while searching for ad hoc solutions to solve the lack of a mounting tripod and video monitor (both of which are advertised in the instruction manual).
“If you’re working long distances while holding it by hand, sometimes it can transmit inaccurate figures,” Sergeant Pysanka said. “It is safer,” he added, “to work when the gear is stationed on the tripod facing the enemy and the operator is working with the monitor under cover.”
The JIM LR, made by the French company Safran, looks like a cross between a virtual reality headset and traditional binoculars, and can be used alongside a mapping application on a computer tablet that Ukrainian troops use to help call in artillery strikes.
At around six pounds, it is far smaller than the four-and-a-half-ton, U.S.-supplied M777 155 mm howitzer that has recently made its way to the frontline in Ukraine’s east. But both pieces of equipment have intricacies that are reminders of the complications that come from supplying a military with foreign matériel.
The M777 is highly mobile and capable of firing long distances, but training has been a bottleneck in deploying the howitzers, Ukrainian officers say. At courses in Germany that lasted a week, the United States trained soldiers to fire the weapon and others to maintain it.
But an oversight nearly delayed all maintenance on the guns at the hard-to-reach front lines, Ukrainian officers said. The entire M777 machine is put together on the imperial system used in the United States, meaning that using a Ukrainian metric wrench on it would be difficult, and would risk damaging the equipment.
Only after sending the guns did the United States arrange for a rushed shipment of toolboxes of imperial-gauge wrenches, said Maj. Vadim Baranik, the deputy commander of a maintenance unit.
But tools can be misplaced, lost or destroyed, potentially leaving guns inoperable unless someone scrounges up a U.S.-supplied wrench.
And the JIM LR, capable of displaying extremely accurate targeting data, supplies the information, known as grid coordinates, in a widely used NATO format that Sergeant Pysanka has to convert to the Soviet-era coordinate system used on the Ukrainians’ maps. Such minor speed bumps and chances for error add up, especially when under the stress of a Russian artillery barrage.
For now, Sergeant Pysanka is focused on learning the range finder. In his small slice of the war, Western-supplied weapons and equipment are limited to a small number of antitank rockets and first-aid kits.
“We can’t boast the same kind of resources that there are in the east,” said Maj. Roman Kovalyov, a deputy commander of the unit that oversees Sergeant Pysanka’s gun position. “What Ukraine gets, we can only see on the TV. But we believe that sooner or later it will turn up here.”

A Russian missile strike destroyed a major grain terminal in Ukraine in Mykolaiv, adding to worries of global food shortages, according to Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s top diplomat. The strike was evidence that statements from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that his troops were not hindering grain exports from Ukraine was “disinformation,” Borrell wrote on Twitter.

The State Department on Monday accused Russia of threatening American journalists in Moscow and rejected Kremlin charges that the Biden administration has censored Russian journalists within the United States.
Ned Price, a spokesman for the State Department, condemned reports that Russia’s foreign ministry had summoned American journalists to a meeting on Monday and warned that their visas and credentials could be at risk in retaliation for what it called U.S. government hostility toward Russian reporters in America.
“Threatening professional journalists for simply trying to do their jobs and seeking to seal off Russia’s population from any foreign information illustrates the flimsiness and the fragility of the Russian government’s narrative,” Mr. Price said.
Reuters first reported on Monday that a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova — on whom the Biden administration imposed sanctions last week — told American journalists at the meeting that Russian journalists in the United States had faced problems with visa renewals, harassment by U.S. intelligence agencies and blocked bank accounts. Ms. Zakharova reportedly warned that American journalists in Russia could face similar problems with visas, credentials and banking.
Mr. Price said the Biden administration continued to issue visas to “qualified” Russian journalists in the United States, and had not revoked their credentials.
The Treasury Department last month imposed sanctions on three news media outlets that it said were directly or indirectly owned by the Russian state: Russia-1, Channel One and NTV. Mr. Price said their revenues “support President Putin’s war,” adding, “Many other both independent and state-linked entities remained unsanctioned.”
Major private American media platforms like YouTube and Google have blocked other Russian news media outlets funded by the Kremlin, including RT and Sputnik, though not at the behest of the U.S. government.
Mr. Price said that Moscow was making a “false equivalency” by suggesting that the U.S. was censoring reporting about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He noted that Russia has criminalized the use of the word “war” to describe its military campaign, which the Kremlin has described as a “special operation.” A new law signed by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in March also allows prison sentences of up to 15 years for people who spread “fake” information about the conflict.
“The Russian government fundamentally and willfully disregards what it means to have a free press, as evidenced by them blocking or banning nearly every independent Russian outlet seeking to report inside their country,” Mr. Price said.

Heavy, close-quarters urban combat has left the situation in the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk unclear and control is likely flipping frequently, the Institute for the Study of War said in an analysis of Monday’s developments. The institute added that it had been unable to verify if Ukrainian forces had lost territory that the regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said had been claimed over the weekend, or if the territory had not been retaken by Ukraine at all.

President Zelensky also said he spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland on Monday about defense support and Ukraine’s bid to join the European Union, which Poland has supported. “I believe that this will be a decision not only about Ukraine, but also about the entire European project. About whether it has a future as a really strong union,” Zelensky said in his nightly address.

The parliament of Ukraine said lawmakers had met with a visiting delegation from South Korea, noting that the two nations have “a lot in common.” “Both countries have an inadequate dictatorship neighbor, both are young democracies,” it said in a Telegram statement. “South Korea has undergone a period of recovery and become one of the world’s most powerful economies. It can become a role model for us in rebuilding the country.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky in his nightly address urged the public to continue bringing global attention to Ukraine’s “struggle for freedom,” saying he was also preparing new appeals for international support. One example he cited was Spain's newly issued postage stamp in support of Ukraine. "It may seem that the postage stamp can’t change anything. But it is a symbol of the attention to our struggle that millions of people will see," he said.

Russia’s U.N. ambassador walked out of a U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday while being directly addressed by Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, who accused Russia of engineering and weaponizing a global food crisis.

“You may leave the room, maybe it’s easier not to listen to the truth, dear ambassador,” said Mr. Michel, as the Russian ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, exited the meeting.

Biden administration officials said Monday that they had obtained seizure warrants for two airplanes owned by Roman Abramovich, a Russian businessman who fell afoul of U.S. sanctions when the aircraft were flown into Russia in March.
The Commerce Department also levied administrative charges against Mr. Abramovich, saying he had failed to obtain a license needed for the U.S.-origin aircraft — a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner and a Gulfstream G650ER — to enter Russia after sanctions were levied on March 2.
The actions come as the Biden administration tries to step up the economic pressure on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. The United States has seized luxury yachts and millions of dollars held by other Russians in accounts across the United States, as well as imposing sanctions on powerful Russians who are deemed to have ties to President Vladimir V. Putin.
While the U.S. has not imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich, officials previously warned that his aircraft faced potential penalties for violating prohibitions that prevent American technology from being sent into Russia. Britain has imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich, the former owner of the Chelsea Football Club in London.
“Russian oligarchs such as Abramovich will not be permitted to violate U.S. export regulations without consequence,” said John Sonderman, director of the Office of Export Enforcement at the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security.

LONDON — For a while it looked as though Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine would prove to be a useful distraction for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
But after months in which the war in Ukraine took the spotlight away from Mr. Johnson’s political woes, they finally caught up with him, and on Monday the prime minister survived a tense no-confidence vote. The too-close-for-comfort result leaves him badly wounded and sets off a volatile period in British politics as he fights to stay in power and fend off potential challengers in his Conservative Party.
The wall-to-wall coverage of the war eclipsed the scandal over Downing Street parties during the lockdown of 2020, and even adversaries of Mr. Johnson — including the Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer — put on hold their demands that the prime minister resign.
But in recent weeks, Britons began turning against the brief, chaotic tenure of their prime minister, with the crowd at St. Paul’s Cathedral booing when he and his wife, Carrie, attended a thanksgiving service for Queen Elizabeth II.
Allies of Mr. Johnson argued that “Partygate,” as the London tabloids called it, was a needless intrusion at a time when Europe was confronting its first major land war since World War II. “It is fundamentally trivial,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former leader of the House of Commons, adding that the affair would soon be forgotten.
Mr. Johnson, who had paid relatively little attention to Ukraine as Russian troops massed along its borders, quickly staked out a position as one of the country’s staunchest defenders in the West. He authorized shipments of powerful weapons to Ukraine’s army and placed regular phone calls to its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was grateful for the support.
The first of several speeches Mr. Zelensky made to foreign Parliaments was delivered to Britain’s House of Commons, and he singled out Mr. Johnson for praise. And Mr. Johnson visited Mr. Zelensky in Kyiv, walking with the president on a street in the capital in a highly visible show of support.
But as the fighting on the other side of Europe has ground on, domestic matters have regained prominence. And while the public remains generally supportive of Mr. Johnson’s handling of Ukraine, the war has burnished the reputations of two other cabinet ministers: Ben Wallace, the defense secretary, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary.
Both appear on lists of potential replacements for Mr. Johnson.

A day after visiting Ukrainian forces near the front line of the war in the east, President Volodymyr Zelensky met with reporters and outlined the enormous challenge of pushing back the Russian invader. “There are more of them,” he said. “They are more powerful. But we have every chance to fight in this direction.”

SVIATOHIRSK, Ukraine — Of the hundreds of battle sites all across Ukraine, the Sviatohirsk Monastery of the Caves surely ranks among the most incongruous.
The sprawling complex of onion-domed churches built into a high bank of the Siversky Donets River is considered one of the five holiest sites in the Russian Orthodox Church. Yet it is directly in the line of fire of the Russian Army in its advance in eastern Ukraine.
Russian shells aimed at Ukrainian troop positions regularly go astray and strike the monastery, provoking terrifying shrieks and metallic booms that echo through the churchyards. The shells tear through walls and leave gaping holes in the grounds; at least four monks, priests or nuns have been killed, Ukrainian police say.
The shelling is yet another example of the collateral damage the Russians are inflicting with errant or indiscriminate artillery strikes. And it has forced the monks and nuns cloistered here into a form of wartime rationalization.
Along with many of the hundreds of displaced people who sought safety in the complex, they are faithful to the Russian church and loyal to its leader in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill, who has blessed the Russian invasion. But the constant bombardment by the Russian Army presents a contradiction that they are forced to reconcile.
“Yes, they shell the monastery but they are probably just following orders,” one nun, Sister Ioanna, said of the Russian soldiers. “We pray for them, too, asking that they realize what they are doing.”

The Kremlin-backed mayor of the Ukrainian town of Enerhodar was standing on his mother’s porch when a powerful blast struck, leaving him critically wounded. A week later, about 75 miles away, a car packed with explosives rocked the office of another Russian-appointed official in the occupied southern city of Melitopol.
In a rarity, both Ukrainian and Russian officials confirmed the blasts, which struck deep inside Russian-controlled territory. And both explosions appeared to be the work of what analysts say is a growing partisan resistance movement — one fueled by increasingly brutal Russian repression and worsening humanitarian conditions.
By their very nature, the clandestine activities of any insurgency are murky and often impossible to verify independently. It is as much in the interest of Ukrainians to play up talk of rebellion as it is for Russians to play it down.
But the explosion that injured the Enerhodar mayor, Andrei Shevchik, is one of more than a dozen high-profile attacks in recent weeks that analysts say indicate increased partisan activity aimed at Russian occupation forces in the Kherson and Zaporizka regions of southern Ukraine.
Stretching tens of thousands of square miles from eastern Ukraine to Russian-occupied Crimea and into Russia itself, those regions were among the first to fall under Russian control following the invasion of Ukraine in late February. Many of their towns and cities were spared the wholesale destruction unleashed by Russian forces elsewhere. In recent days, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of counterattacks in the regions.
In the past month, Ukrainian partisans claim, insurgents have attacked Russian trains and killed dozens of Russian soldiers, as well as supporting the Ukrainian military's counterattacks. Their claims are impossible to independently verify. The partisans also have established a virtual Center of National Resistance, which features instructions for things like setting up ambushes and what to do if arrested.
Alexander Motyl, a historian and Ukraine expert at Rutgers University, has scoured publicly available statements about possible insurgent activity. He said that the data suggests it is growing.
“It is, of course, possible that Ukrainian special forces may have been involved in some of these actions; it is also likely that the data are incomplete,” he wrote for the online journal 1945. “Even so, the number of guerrilla actions is impressive and bespeaks a trend toward ever-greater partisan activity.”
The explosion in Enerhodar and the intrigue that has followed illustrate how Russian efforts to combat insurgency might be deepening the resolve of the partisans.
Enerhodar had a population of 50,000 before the war and was home to many of the people who work at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest. Residents erected wooden barricades on the road leading into the town in the first week of the war but they proved no match for Russian tanks. Russia took control of the town and named Mr. Shevchik mayor.
Then came the blast, which Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reported on May 22, citing an emergency services source in the city. Ukrainian officials confirmed the incident from their own sources and said that it appeared that the mayor was targeted.
Dmytro Orlov, whom Ukraine recognizes as the legitimate mayor of Enerhodar, wrote on Telegram that Russians are trying to tackle the budding insurgency by targeting regular civilians. He said that “the number of abductions of locals has increased significantly” since the explosion involving Mr. Shevchik, and that the humanitarian crisis has worsened.
There is almost no Ukrainian currency left in Enerhodar, Mr. Orlov said, adding that since the occupied forces are trying to make Russia’s ruble the only currency, prices for everyday household products have climbed “sky-high.” Reports of Russian soldiers looting mostly abandoned homes are on the rise, while communications in and out of the city have been severed, he said.
All this, Mr. Orlov said, will cause the ranks of the partisans to grow.
“Even those citizens who had a neutral attitude to the invaders in the beginning are starting to show dissatisfaction with the Russian occupation,” he said.
It appears Mr. Orlov is not alone in thinking that partisans will continue to pose a threat to Russia’s proxies.
Mr. Shevchik’s Russia-appointed replacement, Ruslan Kirpichov erected concrete blast walls outside the hotel where he is living, according to Energoatom, the Ukrainian state enterprise responsible for operating the town’s power stations. It posted a photo of the barricades on its Telegram channel.

COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Drawing parallels between Nazi Germany’s occupation of France and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, America’s top general on Monday used an emotional ceremony near the D-Day landing beaches to urge the United States and its allies to unite to defeat tyranny in Europe.
“Each country is sovereign and has a right to their territorial integrity,” Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a crowd commemorating the 78th anniversary of the Normandy landing.
“While Kyiv may be 2,000 kilometers from here, they are experiencing the same horrors that the French citizenry experienced in World War II at the hands of the Nazi invaders.”
General Milley did not mention President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by name, but he characterized the Ukraine war as a crucial test of the post-World War II order.
“It has been almost eight decades since the defeat of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan,” General Milley said. “And we are again seeing death and destruction on the European continent.”
The presence of around 20 World War II veterans — among the last surviving members of the forces that took part in perhaps the 20th century’s most significant military operation — added poignancy to a day already laden with memories of June 6, 1944, when 4,414 allied troops died.
“The world reacted too slowly to Hitler’s war machine,” General Milley, an avid historian, told those gathered. “The first bomb was dropped at 5:20 a.m. on the 1st of September, 1939, and the people of Western Europe hoped that they would not be next.”
His remarks recalled the skepticism from some quarters that greeted initial American intelligence assessments, beginning late last year, that Mr. Putin was preparing to invade his sovereign neighbor.
General Milley spoke days after the Biden administration approved a shipment of mobile rocket systems to Ukraine to aid in its battle against Russian forces in the east. Senior Pentagon officials say the new long-range weapons will help Ukraine, but could also draw out a war that has stretched past 100 days.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, questioned whether the Ukrainian government could restrain itself as promised from using advanced artillery rocket systems, supplied by the United States, to strike targets inside Russia. He told a news conference that the longer the range of weapons provided to Ukraine by its Western allies, the further Russia will push Ukraine's army back.

Reporting from Kramatorsk, Ukraine
President Volodymyr Zelensky met soldiers and handed out military awards near the frontline in eastern Ukraine, in a visit highlighting his role as a wartime leader and aimed at boosting morale.
The trip on Sunday was shrouded in secrecy beforehand and announced in statements issued late Sunday and early Monday. He traveled to the frontline city of Lysychansk, perhaps the closest he has come to active fighting in the east since the war began.
It’s a perilous journey to reach Lysychansk. A highway and several back roads pass through farm fields pocked with artillery craters. Along the way, an oil refinery that has been on fire for weeks smolders, belching smoke. On the sides of the roads sit the burned orange husks of cars that didn’t make it, pushed aside to make way for others trying to get through.
Officials offered few details of how Mr. Zelensky reached the city, which has been bombarded by artillery and is at risk of being surrounded by Russian forces in one of the hottest areas of the front. The Ukrainian supply lines into the area, along roads that run through plains and are exposed to nearby Russian troops, are often attacked.
“I am proud of everyone with whom I met, whom I shook hands with,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address describing his visit.
He also offered a cryptic statement of support, saying: “We brought something to the military. I will not talk about it in detail.” It was unclear whether the comment referred to deliveries to the front of newly arrived Western weaponry, which soldiers have said are sorely needed to even the fight against better armed Russian forces.
The visit was only the second official trip that Mr. Zelensky — who has signaled his country’s war footing in part by wearing military-style green T-shirts or other army clothing — has taken outside of the region around the capital, Kyiv, since the war began in late February. Staying in Kyiv in the first days of the war as the Russian army bore down also put him within about a dozen miles of frontline fighting. 
In addition to visiting Lysychansk, as part of the same trip, Mr. Zelensky met in the Zaporizhzhia region with civilians who fled the city of Mariupol, which is now under Russian occupation.
“I understood their difficult questions,” he said of the displaced families, some of the total of more than 12 million Ukrainians whom the war has uprooted in a vast migration westward, away from the heaviest fighting.
“Each family has its own story,” he went on. “Most were without men. Someone’s husband went to war; someone’s is in captivity; someone’s, unfortunately, died. A tragedy.”
He added that he delivered a message to the families: “We must live for the children.”

The British military announced on Monday that it would send its most sophisticated multiple-launch rocket system to Ukraine, joining the United States in providing critically-needed long-range artillery at a moment when Russia is using its vast armaments to pummel Ukrainian positions across the eastern front.
The announcement came days after the Biden administration said that it would provide Ukraine with its most advanced multiple-launch rocket system and munitions in the hope of giving the country an edge over Russia.
“As Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine,” said Britain’s defense secretary, Ben Wallace.
President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials have pleaded for such weapons for months, but it could be weeks longer before they make an impact on the battlefield. Ukrainian soldiers must be trained to use the systems, which are far more advanced than anything currently in Kyiv’s arsenal.
The use of overwhelming and often indiscriminate force has allowed the Russians to make limited gains in eastern Ukraine. Moscow’s forces on Monday pounded targets across the 75-mile eastern front line, according to the Ukrainian military.
At the moment, Russian artillery can reach further than the weapons that the Ukrainians have at their disposal, allowing Russian forces to rain down rounds day and night, without the Ukrainians being able to effectively strike back. The barrages have exacted a heavy toll on the Ukrainian army: the Ukrainian government has said that as many as 100 soldiers are dying every day.
The decisions by the United States and Britain mark the latest escalation in a steadily increasing flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in late February.
The United States began sending heavy artillery to Ukraine in April. As of May 26, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said that it had delivered 85 M777 howitzers to Ukraine, as well as 190,000 projectiles for use in those weapons systems.
The multiple-rocket launch systems being supplied by the United States and Britain offer Ukraine the opportunity to strike Russian targets from a far greater distance, and with greater precision.
The American High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, can hit targets nearly 50 miles away and is capable of firing satellite-guided rockets that carry roughly the same explosive power as a 500-pound bomb dropped from the air.
The British M270 multiple-launch rocket system offers similar capabilities, Mr. Wallace said, adding that they “will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against the brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities.”
Before supplying the weapons, the United States was promised by the Ukrainians that they would not use the long-range rockets to go after targets inside Russia. The BBC reported that the British government received similar assurances.
In remarks aired by Russian state media on Sunday, Mr. Putin was dismissive of the U.S. weapons, saying they are “nothing new,” but at the same time warned that if Russia felt threatened, it would “strike those facilities that we are not attacking so far.”

A day after President Vladimir V. Putin threatened to attack new targets if Western nations supplied Ukraine with long-range missile systems, Britain announced on Monday that it would join the United States in providing the advanced weapons to help Ukraine hold off Russia’s assault in the east.
“As Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine,” Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in announcing that Britain would supply rocket systems that can hit targets up to 50 miles away. President Biden said last week that the United States would soon deliver a precision rocket system with a similar range, far beyond what Ukraine currently has in its arsenal, as the fighting in eastern Ukraine increasingly becomes an artillery war.
But there is complication: Sophisticated weaponry is increasingly arriving in Ukraine from Western allies, but Ukrainian soldiers do not always know how to use it. Some have been forced to resort to Google.
Russia’s artillery advantage has been on display in the seesaw battle for Sievierodonetsk, a city that is key to controlling the entire eastern region of Donbas. Russian forces seized a large part of the city last week after weeks of intense bombardment, but Ukrainian forces have clawed back ground in recent days in pitched street-by-street battles.
On Monday, the Russians ramped up artillery attacks and erased some of the Ukrainians’ gains, Serhiy Haidai, the regional governor, said in an interview on television.
As Russia presses its campaign to seize all of Donbas, the longer-range, precision Western rockets could dent Moscow’s advantage. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, questioned whether the Ukrainian government could restrain itself as promised from using the weapons to strike targets inside Russia. The longer the range of weapons provided to Ukraine, he said a news conference Monday, the farther back Russia will push Ukraine’s army.
In other developments:
In an address marking the anniversary of D-Day, Gen. Mark Milley, the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, drew parallels between Nazi Germany’s occupation of France and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made an unannounced visit Sunday to the easternmost city controlled by his government, saluting troops in Lysychansk, which sits just across a river from Sievierodonetsk and has been under near-constant bombardment.
Russia is trying to sell stolen Ukrainian grain to countries in Africa, the United States said.
NATO and European Union nations bordering Serbia closed their airspace to Russia’s foreign minister before his scheduled visit on Monday, Russian state media reported, citing a ministry spokeswoman.

Volunteers are pouring into training camps, including one in Kyiv on Sunday, where dozens of recruits, some with no military experience, were training. Most of them will prepare for less than a month before going to the front lines. The Ukrainian military has called for more volunteers as fighting rages in Donbas.
 Ivan Nechepurenko
Russian forces stepped up artillery attacks on Sievierodonetsk, said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk. The attack has set Ukrainian forces back after a counteroffensive. The Russian tactic “is to wipe everything off the face of the earth, so there would be nothing to defend,” he said.

Even though some residents have been returning to Kyiv, Ukraine's deputy defense minister warned that the city “is constantly under threat.” The minister, Hanna Maliar, appeared on Ukrainian TV hours after the first Russian strikes in the capital in over a month. "We still need to understand that the war is in an intense phase," she said.

The Washington-based research group said Ukraine’s ability to push Russian troops back to the city’s eastern outskirts was more evidence of Moscow’s declining combat power.

CARDIFF, Wales — When it was over, when the referee blew his whistle and the crowd roared and Ukraine’s dream of a place in this year’s World Cup was over, most of its national soccer team dropped straight to the grass. The rest simply stared into space.
The scoreboard confirmed what, in that moment, even the Ukrainians themselves could scarcely believe: Wales 1, Ukraine 0. A World Cup qualifying journey laced with symbolism and spirit and national pride, an opportunity delayed three months by war and reaching its denouement on a day that had begun with explosions in Kyiv, the first direct airstrikes on the capital in a month, had ended not in triumph but in the cruelest of twists: defeat to Wales on an own goal scored by a Ukraine forward, Andriy Yarmolenko.
“The most important game of our lives,” Ukraine defender Oleksandr Karavayev had called it less than 24 hours earlier. And for weeks, he and his teammates had treated their campaign as such: a chance to bring joy to a war-torn nation desperately in need of it, a chance to showcase their pride in their jerseys, in their flag, in themselves.

Reporting from Druzhkivka, Ukraine
A Russian missile landed in a quiet residential area on the outskirts of the eastern Ukrainian town of Druzhkivka overnight on Sunday, causing widespread damage to homes and a Baptist church.
Mykola Holovko, 54, and his son sat in front of their destroyed home, having salvaged what they could. The missile landed across the street from his house, killing a neighbor, he said. Another person was wounded, officials said.
Residents and parishioners cleared up debris around a Baptist church, and people retrieved what they could from their homes.
The town lies to the south of Kramatorsk, the city which serves as the capital of Ukrainian-controlled areas of the Donetsk region. Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine has relied heavily on artillery bombardments to assist advancing troops, often devastating towns and cities in its path.
