Every few months, members of The New York Times pop music team gather for the ritual Popcast mailbag.
On this week’s episode, we answer questions about the current state of rock music, including recent revivals of emo and hardcore; the status of Adele and Chance the Rapper’s careers; the degree to which critics consider extramusical concerns when assessing work; rising talents including Rina Sawayama and Yeat; and much, much more.
Guests:
Joe Coscarelli, The New York Times’s pop music reporter
Caryn Ganz, The New York Times’s pop music editor
Jon Pareles, The New York Times’s chief pop music critic
