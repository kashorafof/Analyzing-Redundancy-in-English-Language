I’m the assistant classical music and dance editor on The Times’s Culture desk.
After years of being a chronic completist, I’m finally learning how to break up with bad books and TV shows.
Here are five things I’m watching and reading instead →
Film: ‘Three Months’
This is basically a gay “Juno,” and I mean that as a compliment. Like Diablo Cody, who wrote that mid-aughts charmer, Jared Frieder finds heart in the story of a teenager learning that he might be H.I.V. positive and having to spend his last summer before college waiting to know for sure.
Exhibition: Ellsworth Kelly’s ‘Postcards’
Part of a trio of Kelly exhibitions now at Matthew Marks’s Chelsea galleries, this show is a delightful glimpse into the playful side of an artist better known for formal austerity. Kelly’s rarely seen postcard collages reflect his sense of space and shape, yes, but also of camp.
TV: ‘New Heights’
What hooked me on this Swiss series was the trope — familiar to many New Yorkers, including me — of reconciling big-city ambition and a small-town background. It’s a beautifully shot, expansive family drama.
TikTok: @goetheinstitut.deutsch
I’ve spent the past year and a half learning German through the Goethe-Institut, but language courses aren’t really designed to teach the most current trends in culture and argot. 
Goethe’s TikTok account, however, is a gift — small doses of trivia and lessons in, say, transgender and nonbinary vocabulary. It’s helpful for students and tourists alike.
See the account.
Novel: ‘Priceless’
As I write this, I’m preparing for a hike in the mountains near Zakopane, Poland. For homework, a friend recommended this Zygmunt Miloszewski art-world thriller, which is partially set there. It’s breezy, a little naughty and rich with twists that keep you on unsure ground.
