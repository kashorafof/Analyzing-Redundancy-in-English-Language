Families cohere by keeping histories and telling stories — and conveying what the English have called heirlooms. The “loom” in heirloom is not coincidental. This root word retains the old expectation that a familial inheritance will include practical tools, such as looms.
For many Black families, kinship bonds have endured through an enlarged definition of the term heirloom that includes everyday items that have come to serve as carriers of tradition and vessels of inheritance.
Here, 10 photographers take up the camera as a loom, weaving stories of kinship and care across generations.

Chanell Stone has never met her great-great-grandmother but she has worn her ancestor’s dress. Ivory in color, silky in fabric and fashioned in a sleek silhouette, the dress is a “sacred object,” said Stone. She was awed when she visited her great-grandmother, the caretaker of the dress, and discovered that, when she tried it on, the classic cut nearly fit her own petite frame. She described the flattering fit of the dress as one of the “beautiful coincidences” accompanying the unveiling of this family heirloom.
For years, Stone’s great-grandmother kept this dress wrapped in plastic in the closet to protect the delicate fabric. Now Stone wears the dress like a second skin and the story of her ancestor like a gown.
Seeing the dress, touching the dress, holding the dress and arranging the dress made Stone want to know her ancestor whom it had belonged to, Mary Lee Saunders. She turned to her great­-grandmother, Zelma Murphy, with whom she is close, to gather that knowledge. The woman who once possessed this dress had sewed it herself and had worn it for a special occasion at church, most likely in the 1940s. She had been religious, traditional and concerned with how she presented herself to the world.
Ceremony
“It’s the one connected thread back to her,” said Stone.
Wrapped in glory, the past and present meet.
Stone also saw the pleasure it brought her great-grandmother to recall memories of her own mother. Zelma Murphy fell “back into being a little girl,” Stone said. “Grandmothers,” she realized, “were once little girls, too.”
Family tells us who we are, where we belong and to whom we belong.
The touch of the past made manifest in a relative’s hand. Beauty is an occasion for ceremony.

For Adraint Bereal, a rediscovered document represents “the oldest thing we own,” he said, “besides our family Bible.” These typescript pages recount the life of his great-great-great-great-grandmother, the matriarch on his father’s side of the family. Born into slavery in Texas, his ancestor was a midwife who lived to be 113 years old.
Bereal believes his ancestor was interviewed by a student as part of a sociology project conducted at Baylor University in 1928. The university library stored the interviews in a file inaccessible to the public. For Bereal, the task of acquiring this document and identifying its provenance was arduous: It took a new librarian with an open attitude to unlock this precious family article. “You know, my relatives are in here, there’s no telling who else’s relatives are in here,” Bereal said of the files.
For this project, Bereal paired stark photographs of the interview document, positioned beneath the cold glare of institutional light, with boisterous family photographs and photographs of photographs. The austerity of the institutional archive meets the abundance of the family archive, bringing his ancestor back into the circle of kin.
Perseverance
Reading the story of his ancestor’s life was like “talking to the dead,” Bereal said.

Much like a quilter selects squares of fabric to form a patchwork scene, Alanna Fields uses colored wax to abstract the patinated family memories found in her great-grandmother’s silk-bound photo album. For Fields, family memory is hazy: Many of the images in her heirloom album — now in her possession — depict people she has never met. The layering of wax on the photos enhances this haziness, its opacity giving the past a texture and presence of its own.
Memory
In her essay “In Our Glory: Photography and Black Life,” the cultural critic bell hooks identifies Black women and mothers as “keepers of walls,” adorning the surfaces of the home with family stills, turning stairwells and hallways into galleries, and photo albums into miniature exhibitions. In lieu of inclusion on the pristine walls of museums or in the temperature-controlled storage rooms of library archives, Black families have created meaningful constellations of memories through the careful arrangement of snapshots.
Dr. Doretha Williams, the director of the Smith Center at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, said in a recent interview: “While piecemeal in nature, collectively the stories of these heirlooms create the larger narrative of Black life lived.”

Soil, hills, trees, grass: Land, tended and inherited by a Black family, is a proving ground of intergenerational love.
Clifford Prince King said of traditional heirlooms: “They seem very white to me. Like the china set.” His prized heirloom is rooted in the Southwestern soil of his father’s ranch. Originally from Louisiana, King’s father purchased this land outside of Tucson, Ariz., in a town called Sahuarita, to “have something that’s his for the first time.”
King recalled his father’s words about the importance of storing up value for future generations: “I want to leave wills, not bills.”
“I will inherit this space,” King said.
In the long, warm light of afternoon, father and son languidly pose, each enjoying the bounty of the other’s respect. The tractor: a current gift from son to father. The land: a future gift from father to son. Time spirals like the planet that holds this ranch in its lap.

The roles of archivist, textile artist and photographer merge in David Alekhuogie’s work, in which he combines objects to create layered still-life images. This practice of collage was inspired in his mother’s kitchen: Alekhuogie’s mother was a cook and a quilter who taught her boys how to prepare meals. Cooking was not only how his mother showed love but was also “like alchemy,” Alekhuogie said, “like magic.”
The “all-American” Betty Crocker Cookbook, a classic text with iconic red lettering, was a gift from Alekhuogie’s father to his mother. Its pages are now torn and worn with time and the preparation of many meals, bearing the personalization of handwritten notes.
Alchemy
Alekhuogie learned to make cornbread, a family favorite, as a child. In one photograph, he presents the Southern dish in a cast iron skillet, on a pine cutting board, atop handmade fabric.
For Alekhuogie, certain African American foods are “really West African.” Through these photographs, he crafts his own diasporic recipe, combining basic ingredients, cooked meals and bright fabrics into a symbolic merger of his mother’s Southern ancestry and his father’s Nigerian heritage.

In the closed circle created by her family’s legs, Naomieh Jovin captures the exuberance of a family unified in play.
Osselets, or “do kre i s,” is a Haitian children’s game that can be played with the knuckle-bones of goats. A cross between jacks and dice games, the game involves players taking turns to throw and skillfully catch bones while seated in a circle. Given goat meat’s high cost, the task of assembling the necessary five game pieces typically requires saving the bones over time, after shared meals and family occasions, collected in bowls and stored in old cookie tins.
After the loss of her parents at a young age, grief colored many of Jovin’s family gatherings. The learning and teaching of Haitian traditions only came later in her life. To play osselets as an adult with her aunt and niece on the carpeted floor of her aunt’s home, Jovin recalled, felt like a joyful act of preservation and remembrance.
“I was always worried about forgetting,” Jovin said.
Jovin recalled the warmth and joy of her aunt’s living room and how the pile-on hugs, the scent of food and the soft thud of game pieces hitting the carpet comprised the sensory experience of togetherness.
Our families make us, and we make our families, birthing, finding, and embracing the people to whom we commit our care.

Jewelry, unlike property, is traditionally passed down along the matriarchal line across many cultures: From mothers to daughters, grandmothers to granddaughters, jewelry can affirm and secure and adorn, a coherence binding one generation beautifully to another.
For Sasha Phyars-Burgess’s Trinidadian family, the ritual among women includes wearing gold and brass bangles decorated with cocoa pods.
“I knew my mom was home because I could hear her jewelry,” Phyars-Burgess recalled. “That's something that I hold with me.”
“Honestly, I don’t take them off,” Phyars-Burgess said of her bangles.

For Trent Bozeman, his great-grandmother’s empty suitcase offers a site of memorialization that can move from kitchen to table, or be filled with new objects of remembrance, such as photographs.
The occasion to take photos of his family, to pose them in his grandparents’ living room in Memphis, Tenn., presented an opening to explore the points of connection that had been neglected over time.
What becomes possible for a Black woman with a suitcase?
At a Sears in the mid-twentieth century, Bozeman’s great-grandmother, Willie Mae Foster, purchased an emerald-green suitcase that could meet her travel needs and carry the hopes and dreams of her kin for decades to come.
“Inside of it, when I first encountered it,” Bozeman remembered, “was my great grandmother’s typewriter. That was her first — as my mom likes to call it — her first big-girl job. Her first job where she was making a salary. It was a typewriter that let her do that. My great grandmother didn’t have the best formal education, and a typewriter, for her, was a way of getting beyond what her and her peers had as a job. It was a way to elevate to the next level of social status.”
Passed down from Bozeman’s great-grandmother Madea and now under the care of his aunt Deborah, a white china tea set affirms the family’s ascension through American social classes. “For her, she just remembers growing up and never being able to use it,” Bozeman said of his aunt. “It was something that was always there for display. Now, she always makes sure she’s using it a couple of times a year.”
For many Black families, there is pride in the attainment of symbols that represent status in Western culture, even if such items only trace back one or two generations. These heirlooms have been especially precious as repositories of memory and sources of joy.

In his Chicago home, George Johnson, Olivia Galli’s grandfather, surrounds himself with Johnson Products Company “hairlooms”: colored Ultra Sheen vials, relaxer kits and afro spray, photographs and newspaper clippings of proud moments. Without high school degrees or initial start-up funds, George and his wife, Joan Johnson, revolutionized Black haircare and Black enterprise.
Galli’s grandparents co-founded the Johnson Product Company in 1954. The Johnson product line featured skincare and haircare formulas for Black consumers, including what Galli calls “the famous blue gel,” or Ultra Sheen. Galli recalled wanting to taste the bright blue emollient as a child because it looked “kind of like candy.”
Galli remembers her mother detangling and dressing her hair with fingers coated in Ultra Sheen. She recalls the “pain and agony” of those moments, “but also the bonding of mother and child.” In these memories, and in these photographs, Galli renders an experience shared by many Black families: the intricate and intimate ritual of hair care.
Sonya Clark, a fiber artist and professor of art at Amherst College, observed in a recent interview: “There is a Yoruba thought that you don't know who you are unless you can name your ancestors ten generations back. Hair knows our ancestors.”

In Daveed Baptiste’s photographs, the heirloom is the human body, artfully posed or surprised in vibrant motion, its gestures a vessel for performance and play.
For Baptiste, the “essence of the body” in prayer, for example, connects Haitian people, histories and religions, from Christianity to the practice of voodoo. “The same prayers that my mother has for us in the house are the same prayers that the revolutionaries of Haiti who fought the French had,” Baptiste said. “I see how that prayer lives in Haitian people and I see how it lives in my mother.”
Secrets, too, can be heirlooms, passed down through knowing glances, kept and divulged over time.
Essence
“When it comes to the men and the women from the Caribbean, specifically from Haiti, it’s this swag,” said Baptiste. “It's this way of dressing. It's the way you carry yourself. It's a skin tone. It's all those things mixed together that has this essence. And when you see her, you're like: ‘That’s a Haitian woman.’”
Heirlooms are hallways connecting past and present, leading us to the sacred rooms of the ancient house.

Secrets, too, can be heirlooms, passed down through knowing glances, kept and divulged over time.
Essence
“When it comes to the men and the women from the Caribbean, specifically from Haiti, it’s this swag,” said Baptiste. “It's this way of dressing. It's the way you carry yourself. It's a skin tone. It's all those things mixed together that has this essence. And when you see her, you're like: ‘That’s a Haitian woman.’”
Heirlooms are hallways connecting past and present, leading us to the sacred rooms of the ancient house.
