Nearly everyone is feeling the sting of inflation.
When I was searching for plane tickets last month for an annual trip out west, prices had nearly doubled from last year. And when I interviewed a truck driver for a recent story, he told me he was considering commuting to work on his motorcycle — 46 miles each way — because it was cheaper than filling up his Jeep.
With the inflation rate near a 40-year high and so much uncertainty in the world, consumers may be shifting their buying habits or making other changes to their financial lives to compensate. We’d love to hear more about how you’re coping with rising prices.
