	Abortion is now banned in at least seven states, with trigger bans in several more set to take effect after the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. On Monday, judges in Louisiana and Utah temporarily blocked each state’s trigger ban and allowed abortions to resume, and others states are already facing legal challenges to their bans.


	The New York Times is tracking abortion laws in each state following the court’s decision.


	About half of states are expected to allow bans or other limits on the procedure to take effect. In several states, the status of abortion isn’t settled: Courts must determine the fate of existing restrictions, or lawmakers are expected to propose new laws to restrict abortion access. In others, abortion rights are protected by state law, and legislators may move to expand access.

9 states;
						11.0 million women of reproductive age
						
					

20 states and D.C.;
						26.5 million women of reproductive age





	These states have trigger laws that have already or will soon ban abortion following the court’s decision; have moved in recent months to restrict abortion; or have existing bans that were temporarily blocked by a judge but could now be enforced.

Why

	Lawmakers in these states have signaled an interest in restricting abortion. In some, the governor or a state constitutional amendment may protect abortion rights in the short term. In others, laws that prohibited abortion before the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade could be enforced again.

Why

	These states are expected to maintain the right to an abortion, and many are working to expand access to the procedure by requiring insurance to pay for it and increasing the number of abortion providers.

An earlier version of this article misstated the legal status of abortion in Utah. As of 4 p.m. on June 24, the state attorney general had issued a statement saying the state’s abortion ban had been triggered, but it had not yet been authorized by the legislature’s general counsel. By 8:30 p.m., the counsel authorized the ban and it went into effect.
