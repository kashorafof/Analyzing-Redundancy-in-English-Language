KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Just to enter Sievierodonetsk, Ukrainian soldiers run a gantlet of Russian artillery shells zeroed in on the only access route: a bridge littered with the burned husks of cars and trucks that didn’t make it.
And once inside the city in eastern Ukraine, the focus of both armies for the past several weeks, Ukrainian soldiers battle Russians in back-and forth combat for control of deserted, destroyed neighborhoods.
Ukraine’s leaders now face a key strategic decision: whether to withdraw from the midsize city and take up more defensible positions, or to remain and risk being boxed in if the bridge is blown up. It reflects the choices the country has had to make since the Russian invasion began, between giving ground to avert death and destruction in the short term, and holding out against long odds in hopes it will later pay off.
In Sievierodonetsk, that calculation has taken on significance beyond the city’s limited military importance. In remarks to journalists on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Sievierodonetsk and its neighbor across the river, Lysychansk, as “dead cities” ravaged by Russian attacks and nearly empty of civilians.
And yet he insisted there was a compelling reason to stay and fight: Ukraine’s position throughout the war has been that it intends to hold onto its sovereign territory, and not yield it to Moscow.
Retreating now to better positions on higher ground across the Seversky Donets River, and then fighting to retake the city later, he said, would be harder and carry a higher price in bloodshed than holding on.
“It will be very costly for you to return, in terms of the number of people killed, the number of losses,” Mr. Zelensky said.
“Our heroes are not giving up positions in Sievierodonetsk,” he added. “Fierce urban combat continues in the city.”
It was a rare public rumination by Mr. Zelensky on strategic decision-making in the war, providing a window into the goals of his government and its military. Sievierodonetsk is the last major city in the breakaway region of Luhansk that the Russians have not taken; capturing it would give them near-total control of that enclave.
There are other factors as well. Falling back could be demoralizing to Ukraine’s forces. And some Ukrainian soldiers said it is worth drawing out the phase of urban combat to inflict more casualties on the already depleted Russian forces, and possibly damage their morale.
It was also possible Mr. Zelensky was aiding the military with misdirection by signaling one intention while quietly pursuing an opposite course of action.
The government has not said how many military casualties Ukraine has suffered overall since the Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin ordered the invasion in February. But Mr. Zelensky said last week that in the recent, intense fighting, each day his country was losing 60 to 100 soldiers killed and 500 wounded. Russia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Tuesday that 6,489 Ukrainian service members had been captured.
Ukraine’s Interior Ministry this week estimated civilian casualties at 40,000 killed or wounded, though some government officials say the true figures are higher. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that ruptured sewer and water pipes in the southern city of Mariupol, seized by Russia after a devastating siege, have created a risk of severe disease outbreaks that would raise the civilian toll.
The battle for Sievierodonetsk, part of Luhansk and the broader Donbas region in the east, has raged now for weeks, and some Ukrainian soldiers have questioned why the army has not ordered a tactical retreat.
“They are killing a lot of our guys,” said a soldier who asked to be identified only by his nickname, Kubik, interviewed last week while smoking beside a road in the town of Siversk, a staging area to the west of the fighting. He had recently rotated away from positions near Sievierodonetsk.
“Let them come forward a little bit, let them think they have captured the town, and then we will meet them beautifully” from the more advantageous position, he said.
The city lies on the mostly flat, eastern bank of the Seversky Donets. The western bank, in contrast, rises in a prominent hill that provides commanding views and firing positions.
Earlier in the war, Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded in Mariupol and fought for weeks, eventually retreating to hold just a tiny pocket of ground in a steel factory complex where they sheltered in bunkers, before Mr. Zelensky ordered the holdouts to surrender rather than be killed.
Ukrainian commanders decided to avert a smaller-scale version of that siege earlier this week in Sviatohirsk, a town lying on the low bank of the Seversky Donets.
Trying to trap Ukrainian troops in the town, Russian forces had been firing artillery at their only remaining route across the river, a bridge near an Orthodox monastery that was also frequently hit. On Monday, the Ukrainian army pulled back, blew up the bridge and took up positions on the river’s high bank, Ukrainian officials said.
Sievierodonetsk was once a sleepy, provincial backwater of about 100,000 residents, with streets lined with poplar trees and a skyline dominated by smokestacks of a fertilizer factory.
Now it is a largely abandoned ruin where battle lines sway often, with each side at times claiming to have expelled the other from part of the city. On Tuesday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian military governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces were again storming positions. “Combat continues,” he said.
Russian artillery fire into the potential fallback position on the high bank, where Lysychansk lies, has also been ferocious. Shelling hit a market, a mining academy and a school, Mr. Haidai said. The strike on the market touched off a fire that burned through the day Monday. Two civilians were wounded.
The Ukrainian government has been emphasizing the tenuousness of its positions in the battle for Donbas, the mining and farming region now mostly controlled by Russian forces.
The pivotal access bridge to Sievierodonetsk is a panorama of destruction, testifying to the difficulty and risk to Ukraine in holding even some portion of the city.
A video recorded by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporters who entered on a resupply run last week showed the mayhem on the span: crossing it meant weaving between the burned husks of cars and shell craters in the bridge deck.
The debris has piled up over the past two weeks. In an interview in late May, a soldier at a sandbagged checkpoint at the western edge of the bridge cautioned that Russian artillery spotters had the span — clear of debris at the time — under observation and opened fire whenever a car drove over. Two other bridges into the city were destroyed earlier in May.
Mr. Haidai has justified Ukraine’s efforts to hold Sievierodonetsk as partly a matter of symbolic resistance.
“Strategically, the city of Sievierodonetsk is not of great importance,” he said over the weekend. The high opposite riverbank is more significant militarily, he said. “But politically, Sievierodonetsk is a regional center. Its liberation will lift our morale substantially and demoralize the Russians.”
Still, Mr. Zelensky said he was open to reconsidering his decision based on developments. Either command — to hold ground or to retreat — had potential downsides, he said.
“In the first option there is risk, in the second option there is risk,” he said.

In anticipation of a difficult winter, Ukraine will be reserving its gas and coal for domestic use instead of exporting it, President Zelensky said in his nightly address. The country will also seek to increase its electricity exports, rebuild power plants damaged by the war and prevent increases to residents’ gas and electricity tariffs, he said.

Ukraine will soon launch a data collection system — a “Book of Executioners” — on Russian forces determined to have committed or ordered war crimes, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address. The system, which Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have said for months would be part of their efforts to hold Russia accountable, is set to launch next week.

An effort by right-wing lawmakers in Sweden to oust the justice minister via a no-confidence vote became embroiled in geopolitics on Tuesday, complicating Sweden’s bid to become part of the NATO military alliance after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
A lawmaker of Iranian-Kurdish origin abstained from the razor-close, no-confidence vote, defeating it and averting a political crisis for the government of Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.
But the lawmaker, Amineh Kakabaveh, exacted a price, first securing a commitment from the government that Sweden would not bow to Turkish demands tied to the NATO application.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has threatened to block Sweden and Finland from joining NATO, criticizing the nations for hosting Kurdish militants he views as his country’s main enemy.
Prime Minister Andersson admonished the backers of the no-confidence vote over their timing.
“We are in a very sensitive position for our NATO application,” she said, calling the move “utterly irresponsible.”
She said: “We are not in a position to play political games in Sweden. It’s dangerous.”
Sweden’s far-right parties had accused Ms. Andersson’s center-left government of failing to address increasing gun violence and crime in the country, tying it to rising levels of immigration, and had called for the justice minister, Morgan Johansson, to step down. Conservative parties also supported the no-confidence motion.

At least 4,253 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded in late February, and the true death toll is likely much higher, the United Nations human rights office said Tuesday. Another 5,141 have been injured. More than half of the casualties occurred in the two eastern regions that Russia is trying to capture. Most of the civilian deaths were caused by missile strikes, multiple-launch rocket strikes, artillery barrages and airstrikes, the U.N. said.

The intensity of artillery duels in Donbas was evident in newly released satellite images from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Fields outside Sloviansk, near the border between Donetsk and Luhansk, were peppered with craters caused by artillery explosions.

Ivan, a 12-year-old Ukrainian boy, was woken up by the sound of a shell exploding near his home in Kurakhove, in the Donetsk region, on Tuesday. Later that day, Ivan and his friends went swimming. “Bombing is routine here now,” he said. “But when we come here to swim, we can relax and have fun, and you don’t think about about the war.”

FORT WORTH, Texas — The mood was celebratory on a recent sultry morning when 30 young pianists from around the world gathered in an auditorium at Texas Christian University for the start of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, one of the most prestigious contests in classical music.
But politics also loomed. The Cliburn, defying pressure to ban Russian competitors after the invasion of Ukraine, had invited six Russians to take part, as well as two pianists from Belarus, which has supported the Russian invasion. A Ukrainian also made the cut.
Several competitors from those countries said that they found it difficult to think beyond the war.
“It’s a tragedy, what’s happening now,” said Dmytro Choni, a 28-year-old pianist from Kyiv. “I’m trying to stay focused on the music.”
Ilya Shmukler, 27, a competitor from Russia, said he at times felt guilty about the invasion. “The key words for me,” he said, “are shame and responsibility.”
The politics surrounding the Cliburn competition show the depths to which the war has upended the performing arts.
Largely unaccustomed to grappling with geopolitical concerns, arts organizations are now being forced to resolve difficult questions about the rights of Russian and Ukrainian artists, the morality of cultural boycotts and the limits of free expression. Many institutions have cut ties with artists closely associated with President Vladimir V. Putin, while continuing to welcome Russians with less public political leanings.
Competitions like the Cliburn, which help determine who rises in the field, have come under intense scrutiny. Some contests, responding to pressure from board members and activists, have banned Russians altogether. Others have announced plans to disinvite Russians, only to face a backlash and reverse course weeks later.
The Cliburn was named for Van Cliburn, an American whose victory at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1958, during the Cold War, was seen as a sign that art could transcend politics. The competition’s organizers have said that the Cliburn has an obligation to defend Russian artists, who have long been a prominent force in classical music, though they have warned competitors that statements in support of Putin or the invasion of Ukraine could result in disqualification.
“I don’t think sanctioning a young pianist who is 22 years old will have an effect on the Russian government,” said Jacques Marquis, the Cliburn’s president and chief executive. “That will play exactly into the playbook of Putin, if we isolate the Russian people.”
Though widely applauded in the arts world, the decision to allow Russians to compete has alienated some Ukrainian activists and Texas residents. 
“It’s a shame that the Cliburn is not paying attention to human suffering and public opinion,” said the Rev. Pavlo Popov, the leader of a Ukrainian church in suburban Dallas. “How do you influence Russia? It has to come from the people. If they don’t like the war, if they want to be a part of the civilized world, if they want to be part of these competitions, they have to stand for the same values.”
Many of the Russian competitors now live outside Russia and have said that they are fiercely opposed to the invasion. Some have taken part in protests and signed petitions demanding the withdrawal of Russian forces.
Anna Geniushene, a 31-year-old pianist from Moscow, said she felt a duty as an artist to show solidarity with Ukraine. 
“I have a lot of chats with different people who are really surprised to know that the entire population, the whole nation, is not supporting and rooting for Putin,” said Geniushene, who lives in Lithuania. “Being an artist doesn’t mean that you are a kind of freelancer, that you’re living in a completely different world, and that you forget about politics and everything that you are not involved in. You must speak up and spread the word.”

The remains of dozens of bodies of Ukrainian service members killed in the battle for the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have been returned to Ukraine and have begun arriving in Kyiv, the Ukrainian government announced on Tuesday.
Many of the dead fighters were members of the Azov regiment, which led the defense of the city for months under relentless Russian attack from ground, sea and air until their surrender in May.
Ukraine’s Ministry for Reintegration of Occupied Territories over the weekend announced the first officially confirmed exchange of war dead since the conflict began. It said the two sides had exchanged a total of 320 bodies, each getting back 160 sets of remains. It gave no details on where the bodies were recovered from.
On Tuesday, the Ukrainian government, citing the Association of Families of Defenders of Azovstal, said that about a third of the bodies turned over by Russia were of members of the Azov regiment. Forensic experts are examining the bodies and conducting DNA analysis in an effort to determine their identities.
With Mariupol fully under Russian control, it is not clear whether all bodies have been recovered from the plant.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to journalists in Kyiv on Monday, said that Russia was holding more than 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers from the steel plant as prisoners of war. While little is known about their condition, he said Ukraine’s first objective regarding the soldiers had been achieved: They were able to leave the plant with their lives.
“Today there is the second part — to bring them home alive,” he said.

Reporting from Warsaw
Exiled leaders from the Russian-occupied southern port city of Mariupol are warning that there is a growing risk of disease outbreaks because sewage systems are not working, dead bodies are still rotting in the streets and tens of thousands who remain in the ruin do not have access to clean water.
The Mariupol City Council outlined the dangers in a post on Telegram, saying the summer heat had “accelerated the decomposition of thousands of corpses under the rubble.”
“The city is literally drowning in garbage and sewage,” the council said.
Russian state media denounced the reports as propaganda and denied suggestions from Ukrainian officials that a quarantine was being put in place to limit a cholera outbreak.
It was not possible to independently verify either side’s claims because Russian forces have banned international relief agencies from working in the city. No confirmed cases have been reported publicly. But global health experts have been raising alarms for weeks about the dangers posed by infectious disease in communities destroyed by the Russian assault.
“We are concerned about the potential cholera outbreak in occupied areas where water and sanitation infrastructure is damaged or destroyed,” Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, said during a news conference when he visited Kyiv last month.
The Russian appointed minister for health in the occupied territory in the Donetsk region, Alexander Oprishchenko, told the Russian state media outlet Tass that the situation was being monitored and is under control.
“There is no outbreak of cholera either in Mariupol or in other cities of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” he said.
Dorit Nitzan, a regional health emergency director for W.H.O., said last month that the danger was particularly acute in Mariupol, with the agency’s partners on the ground in the city reporting “actual swamps in the streets.”
“Sewage water and drinking water are getting mixed,” she said. “This is a huge hazard for many infections, including cholera.”
Cholera is a virulent disease closely linked to lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation. It can cause severe acute watery diarrhea that can kill within hours if not treated. While it can be treated easily with the prompt administration of an oral rehydration solution, the Mariupol City Council said that there was virtually no medicine available in the city and that the health care system was not functioning.
On Monday, Ukraine’s chief sanitary doctor, Ihor Kuzin, told reporters that the national authorities began monitoring potential cholera outbreaks across the country on June 1.
“We can’t be 100 percent sure that there will be disease outbreaks,” he said. “But all prerequisites for them are already there.”

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that Russia has captured 6,489 Ukrainian service members, including more than 100 who had surrendered in recent days. On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that around 2,500 fighters who held out at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have surrendered to Russian forces.

As Ukraine fights to hold defensive positions in the Donbas region in the face of an unrelenting Russian bombardment, its military planners are increasingly confronting the difficult question of whether to withdraw from frontline cities to preserve soldiers’ lives, even if it means a more brutal fight to regain the territory.
President Volodymyr Zelensky offered a window into the dilemma facing Ukraine in the eastern cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, describing them in remarks to journalists on Monday as “dead cities” ravaged by Russian attacks and nearly empty of civilians. If Ukrainian forces do not withdraw, they risk being encircled and besieged, as fighters were in Mariupol, where more than 2,000 eventually had to surrender to Russian custody.
But a retreat from Sievierodonetsk, which Russia has surrounded from three sides, and where Russia and Ukraine have waged fierce street battles for days, would give Moscow control of the entire Luhansk region, which is part of Donbas, and make future attempts to retake the city even more costly, Mr. Zelensky added.
Mr. Zelensky’s stature as a wartime leader is built in part on his vow that Ukraine will fight to regain all of its territory, even the lands in Donbas and Crimea seized by Russia and Moscow-allied separatists beginning in 2014. On Monday, he said that if Russia succeeded in its objective of gaining control of the entire industrial Donbas region, it would present an existential challenge, giving Russia territory from which it can launch “constant missile strikes on the center of Ukraine.”
But he promised that the military would not let that happen, telling the nation later in his overnight address: “The Ukrainian Donbas stands. It stands firmly.”
One sign of hope for the still vastly outgunned Ukrainian military is the arrival of some powerful Western weapons systems that the United States and its allies hope will help dent Russia’s advantage in firepower. As Ukraine races to train its soldiers on the more sophisticated new weapons, they may already be having an effect in the Black Sea, where the Ukrainian Navy said on Monday that Russian warships had pulled back more than 70 miles from the Ukrainian coast, a development that it attributed to the arrival of Harpoon anti-ship missile systems from Denmark.
But the Russians still control the sea, where their naval forces have in effect imposed a blockade to strangle the Ukrainian economy, preventing Ukraine from exporting millions of tons of grain needed around the world.
In other developments:
Charles Michel, president of the European Council, accused Russia of using its leverage over the world’s food supply as “a stealth missile against developing countries.”
Exiled leaders from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol warned of a growing risk of disease because sewage systems are not working, dead bodies are rotting in the streets and tens of thousands who remain in the ruin lack access to clean water.
Bodies of soldiers killed in the battle for the Azovstal steel plant have been returned to Ukraine.
A Ukrainian government official said that more than 40,000 Ukrainian civilians had been killed or injured since Moscow invaded, and that roughly three million are now living under Russian occupation.

Far from Ukraine’s embattled eastern front, a new struggle is being waged — not from the trenches, but over leafy side streets and broad avenues. That is where the enemy goes by the name Pavlov. Or Tchaikovsky. Or Catherine the Great.
Across Ukraine, officials are starting projects to, as they say, “decolonize” their cities. Streets and subway stops whose names evoke the history of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union are under scrutiny by a population eager to rid itself of traces of the nation that invaded in late February.
“We are defending our country, also on the cultural front lines,” said Andriy Moskalenko, the deputy mayor of Lviv and the head of a committee that has reviewed the names of each of the city’s more than 1,000 streets. “And we don’t want to have anything in common with the killers.”
Ukraine is far from the first country to undertake such a historical accounting — the United States has wrestled for decades with the renaming of Civil War-era monuments. Nor is it even the first time Ukraine has undertaken such an effort: After the fall of the Soviet Union, it was one of many Eastern European countries that renamed streets and removed statues commemorating an era of Communist rule that became synonymous with totalitarianism.
This time, the decision to erase Russian names is not just a symbol of defiance toward the invasion and Soviet history, said Vasyl Kmet, a historian at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. It is also about reasserting a Ukrainian identity that many feel has been repressed under centuries of domination by its more powerful neighbor, he said.
“The concept of decolonization is a little broader,” Mr. Kmet said. “Russian politics today is built on the propaganda of the so-called Russky mir — the Russian-speaking world. This is about creating a powerful alternative, a modern Ukrainian national discourse.”
The western city of Lviv is one of many areas undertaking “decolonization” campaigns. So, too, is the northwestern city of Lutsk, which plans to rename over 100 streets. In the southern port city of Odesa, whose inhabitants are mostly Russian-speaking, politicians are debating whether to remove a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in 1794.
In Kyiv, the capital, the City Council is looking into renaming the Leo Tolstoy subway stop after Vasyl Stus, a Ukrainian poet and dissident. The “Minsk” stop — named after the capital of Belarus, which has stood by Moscow during the invasion — may soon be rechristened as “Warsaw,” honoring Poland’s support for Ukraine.
And it’s not only Russian names that are under scrutiny. The Lviv committee also plans to delete street names in tribute to some Ukrainians. One is named after the writer Petro Kozlaniuk, who collaborated with Soviet security agencies, including the K.G.B.
Removing the names of some cultural icons — which the Lviv committee said it did after consulting with academics from the relevant fields — has proved more divisive. The history of figures like Pyotr Tchaikovsky can be tricky: The classical composer’s family roots were in modern-day Ukraine, and some musicologists say his works were inspired by Ukrainian folk music.
A few miles from Lviv, Viktor Melnychuk owns a sign-making factory gearing up to make new plaques and posts for renamed streets. Although he acknowledges that he has a business interest in each change, he is ambivalent about some of the new names.
“Maybe we should keep some classic writers or poets if they are from other periods. I’m not sure,” he said. “We can’t reject everything completely. There was some good there.”
But he planned to stand by the committee’s decisions. And its ruling was unanimous: Tchaikovsky would go.
“When we rename a street, it doesn’t mean we are saying: ‘This person didn’t make this invention, or was not important,’” said Mr. Moskalenko, the deputy mayor of Lviv. “It means this person’s work has been used as a tool of colonization.”
Mr. Kmet, the historian, saw an opportunity to honor the contributions of some Ukrainians whose contributions have been lost to history. He is hoping to name one street in Lviv after an obscure librarian, Fedir Maksymenko, who he said secretly safeguarded Ukrainian culture and books during the Soviet era.
“I and Ukrainian culture owe a lot to him,” he said. “We must work very hard today to preserve what he saved.”
An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a location in Lviv, Ukraine. The picture was taken on Tomashivskoho Street, not on Tchaikovsky Street.

Fiji has handed over to the United States a $325 million superyacht that American investigators say is owned by a Russian billionaire on a U.S. sanctions list, the island nation’s top prosecutor said on Tuesday.
The handover of the yacht, the Amadea, was based on a decision by Fiji’s Supreme Court and is a new development in a global effort to seize the assets of oligarchs with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
The Amadea was held in Fijian waters in April in response to a U.S. request for assistance and seized last month based on a warrant that had been issued by a federal court in Washington and accepted by a Fijian court.
The Amadea’s ownership structure is murky. American investigators say that the yacht was sold last year to Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian government official and billionaire investor who has been on the U.S. sanctions list since 2018. But Feizal Haniff, a lawyer in Fiji who represents a company in the British Virgin Islands that controls the vessel, has argued that its true owner is Eduard Khudainatov, a wealthy Russian who is not under U.S. sanctions.
Fiji’s Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Haniff’s appeal in late May but said that the judgment would not take effect for seven days. Last week, he filed another application asking the Fijian authorities to delay enforcing the U.S. warrant.
On Tuesday, the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the yacht could leave Fiji in the care of the U.S. authorities, Christopher Pryde, the country’s director of public prosecutions, said in a statement.

Russia is facing mounting criticism that it is holding hostage millions of tons of Ukrainian wheat, a vital food supply, for political gain amid a worsening hunger crisis.
Charles Michel, president of the European Council, on Monday accused Russia of using its leverage over the world’s food supply as “a stealth missile against developing countries.” The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said Monday that a Russian missile had destroyed a major grain terminal in the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv in recent days, contradicting Moscow’s claims that it wasn’t responsible for blocking Ukraine’s food exports from reaching those in need.
“This is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty and destabilizing entire regions,” Mr. Michel said at the U.N. Security Council. “Russia is solely responsible for this food crisis.”
Mr. Michel’s remarks prompted Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, to walk out of the room in protest. 
Mr. Michel responded: “You may leave the room. Maybe it’s easier not to listen to the truth, dear ambassador.”
Moscow has sought to blame the sanctions on Russia for fanning global food insecurity. A food crisis could benefit Russia on the world stage: The African Union president last week echoed the Kremlin’s position that sanctions had added to Africa’s difficulty in accessing grain, calling President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia his “dear friend.”
The U.S. has warned that the Kremlin was seeking to sell grain it plundered from Ukraine to desperate nations with few choices to feed its people. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of stealing up to 500,000 tons of Ukrainian wheat, worth $100 million, since February.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday that he had spoken to the Turkish president about getting Turkey’s help in securing safe passage for ships carrying grain exports through the Black Sea. The bottleneck of about 22 million to 25 million tons of grain stuck in Ukraine will get far worse after the fall harvest, when the stock will balloon to 75 million tons, he said.
“We now have Russia’s information narrative that food shortages are due to Ukraine, due to the fact that we do not export. This is untrue, and you know it very well,” he said.

The State Department on Monday accused Russia of threatening American journalists in Moscow and rejected Kremlin charges that the Biden administration has censored Russian journalists within the United States.
Ned Price, a spokesman for the State Department, condemned reports that Russia’s foreign ministry had summoned American journalists to a meeting on Monday and warned that their visas and credentials could be at risk in retaliation for what it called U.S. government hostility toward Russian reporters in America.
“Threatening professional journalists for simply trying to do their jobs and seeking to seal off Russia’s population from any foreign information illustrates the flimsiness and the fragility of the Russian government’s narrative,” Mr. Price said.
Reuters first reported on Monday that a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova — on whom the Biden administration imposed sanctions last week — told American journalists at the meeting that Russian journalists in the United States had faced problems with visa renewals, harassment by U.S. intelligence agencies and blocked bank accounts. Ms. Zakharova reportedly warned that American journalists in Russia could face similar problems with visas, credentials and banking.
Mr. Price said the Biden administration continued to issue visas to “qualified” Russian journalists in the United States, and had not revoked their credentials.
The Treasury Department last month imposed sanctions on three news media outlets that it said were directly or indirectly owned by the Russian state: Russia-1, Channel One and NTV. Mr. Price said their revenues “support President Putin’s war,” adding, “Many other both independent and state-linked entities remained unsanctioned.”
Major private American media platforms like YouTube and Google have blocked other Russian news media outlets funded by the Kremlin, including RT and Sputnik, though not at the behest of the U.S. government.
Mr. Price said that Moscow was making a “false equivalency” by suggesting that the U.S. was censoring reporting about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He noted that Russia has criminalized the use of the word “war” to describe its military campaign, which the Kremlin has described as a “special operation.” A new law signed by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in March also allows prison sentences of up to 15 years for people who spread “fake” information about the conflict.
“The Russian government fundamentally and willfully disregards what it means to have a free press, as evidenced by them blocking or banning nearly every independent Russian outlet seeking to report inside their country,” Mr. Price said.

Heavy, close-quarters urban combat has left the situation in the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk unclear and control is likely flipping frequently, the Institute for the Study of War said in an analysis of Monday’s developments. The institute added that it had been unable to verify if Ukrainian forces had lost territory that the regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said had been claimed over the weekend, or if the territory had not been retaken by Ukraine at all.

The parliament of Ukraine said lawmakers had met with a visiting delegation from South Korea, noting that the two nations have “a lot in common.” “Both countries have an inadequate dictatorship neighbor, both are young democracies,” it said in a Telegram statement. “South Korea has undergone a period of recovery and become one of the world’s most powerful economies. It can become a role model for us in rebuilding the country.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky in his nightly address urged the public to continue bringing global attention to Ukraine’s “struggle for freedom,” saying he was also preparing new appeals for international support. One example he cited was Spain's newly issued postage stamp in support of Ukraine. “It may seem that the postage stamp can’t change anything. But it is a symbol of the attention to our struggle that millions of people will see,” he said.

Biden administration officials said Monday that they had obtained seizure warrants for two airplanes owned by Roman Abramovich, a Russian businessman who fell afoul of U.S. sanctions when the aircraft were flown into Russia in March.
The Commerce Department also levied administrative charges against Mr. Abramovich, saying he had failed to obtain a license needed for the U.S.-origin aircraft — a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner and a Gulfstream G650ER — to enter Russia after sanctions were levied on March 2.
The actions come as the Biden administration tries to step up the economic pressure on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. The United States has seized luxury yachts and millions of dollars held by other Russians in accounts across the United States, as well as imposing sanctions on powerful Russians who are deemed to have ties to President Vladimir V. Putin.
While the U.S. has not imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich, officials previously warned that his aircraft faced potential penalties for violating prohibitions that prevent American technology from being sent into Russia. Britain has imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich, the former owner of the Chelsea Football Club in London.
“Russian oligarchs such as Abramovich will not be permitted to violate U.S. export regulations without consequence,” said John Sonderman, director of the Office of Export Enforcement at the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security.
