	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 260 million people had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, including about 222.3 million people who had been fully vaccinated by the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine or the two-dose series made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.


	The C.D.C. also reported that about 106.3 million fully vaccinated people have received an additional vaccine dose or a booster dose, the highest level of protection against the virus.


	Everyone 6 months and older is currently eligible to be fully vaccinated with an initial round or “primary series” of the vaccine. Regulators also recommend a booster dose for those 5 and up who are fully vaccinated and five months past their second shot. Some people 5 and older with weakened immune systems are also eligible for additional shots and they are included in the booster category below.


	On March 29, federal regulators authorized second booster shots for those 50 and older, and for individuals with certain immune deficiencies.

	Vaccination and booster coverage varies widely by age, in part because older adults became eligible first and some younger children are not yet permitted. In addition, booster eligibility depends on the time since an individual’s last shot. Vaccinations also vary among states, and jurisdictions with lower adult vaccination rates also tend to have reduced coverage among children and teens.


	Providers are reporting that they have administered about 356,000 doses per day on average, including first, second and additional or booster doses.


	Some jurisdictions have reached a larger share of their population with vaccines and boosters than others.

	Vaccination rates reported by the C.D.C. can differ from those published by states and territories because of lags and temporary errors in data reporting. Booster doses can also be misclassified as first doses, which may overcount first dose coverage, according to the C.D.C.

*Includes doses provided to Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

	There are many reasons eligible people are not vaccinated or boosted. Surveys have indicated that some people are adamant in their refusal of the coronavirus vaccines, while others are open to getting a shot but have been putting it off or want to wait and see before making a decision for themselves or for their children.


	The first group, surveys have shown, tends to be disproportionately white, rural, evangelical Christian and Republican. The second group tends to be a more diverse and urban group, including many younger people, Black and Latino residents, and Democrats.


	Speed hasn’t been the only priority for the country’s vaccination campaign. The Biden administration has also committed to distributing shots equitably to the communities most affected by the pandemic.


	More than a year into the rollout, the most socially vulnerable counties in the U.S. have a lower vaccination rate on average than the nation’s least vulnerable. A majority of the most disadvantaged counties with the fewest fully vaccinated people are in the South, while the most vaccinated, least vulnerable counties are in the Midwest and the Northeast.


	Counties are ranked according to the Social Vulnerability Index, a C.D.C. indicator used in public health crises that is based on socioeconomic status, housing, transportation, race, ethnicity and language. Each county’s vaccination rate is its share of all residents that have been fully vaccinated, a figure that does not reflect those who have received only one dose of a two-shot vaccine.


	Everyone 6 months and older is now eligible for a coronavirus vaccine, after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for those under 5 in June.


	Three coronavirus vaccines are in use across the country, including the two-dose mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna and the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine, though children 6 and older are eligible for only Pfizer. Although Johnson & Johnson is still available for use, regulators have suggested that people should opt for one of the mRNA vaccines because of concerns about a rare but serious blood clotting condition among those who received the company’s shot.


	The vaccine rollout began in December 2020, with a focus on some of the most vulnerable populations, including health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities and people 65 and older. Although eligibility for these groups initially varied by state and county, every state had made all adults eligible for the shots by April 2021, according to a Times survey.


	In May 2021, the F.D.A. extended its emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine to children 12 and older.


	Then in August 2021, regulators gave emergency use authorization for people with weakened immune systems to get a third dose of the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines, and they expanded that authorization in September and October to include booster shots for many residents. Regulators opened up booster eligibility to all adults in November and to children ages 12 to 17 in January 2022. The F.D.A. recommended second booster shots for people 50 and older, and for individuals with certain immune deficiencies in March 2022.


	The federal government formally approved the Pfizer vaccine for those 16 and older in August 2021, the first full approval of a Covid-19 vaccine in the country. Emergency use authorization of the vaccine continues for those ages 5 to 15 and for those receiving additional doses. In late January 2022, the F.D.A. granted full approval to Moderna’s vaccine, which can be administered to adults.


	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Nov. 30, 2021, that its vaccination figures may overestimate first doses and underestimate booster doses, as shot order isn’t consistently collected when individuals get boosters. This potential overestimate in the federal data is particularly noticeable in the 65-and-older group. Additional details can be found in the C.D.C.’s footnotes.


	The C.D.C. now provides weekly updates of its data on vaccines administered and reports detailed notes here, including historical revisions from individual states, which can result in additions or subtractions.


	The federal data may differ from that reported by states and territories, which may post on different schedules.


	The C.D.C. notes that total doses administered are based on the location where the vaccine was given, and that in limited cases, people may get a vaccine outside their place of residency. As of Feb. 23, 2021, the C.D.C. reports the number of people receiving one or more doses based on where individuals reside.


	In addition to delivering vaccines to states, territories and some federal agencies, the C.D.C. also distributes doses to three small countries that have special agreements with the U.S. government: Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. Doses used in these locations are included in total U.S. figures.
