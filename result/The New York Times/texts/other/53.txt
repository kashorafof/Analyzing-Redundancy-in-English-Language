So much of what we hear about abortion comes from people who would have us think that abortion stories conform to tidy, black-and-white narratives — that they are either uniformly uncomplicated experiences or overwhelmingly regretful ones.


But abortion stories aren’t tidy. Because people’s lives aren’t tidy.


Several months ago, we asked readers to tell us about a time when they confronted the decision of whether to have an abortion. We received hundreds of stories; what we soon found was that many of them felt remarkably untethered from the national debate about this issue. The reality of abortion, our readers told us, is nuanced, and the emotions involved are often unpredictable.With America entering a new era, in which so many more abortion decisions will be made for people by the state, it feels critical to allow space for the messy complexities of abortion. Because while these stories don’t always fit into the narratives of those who would argue that abortion is either good or bad, what they do illustrate, at this crucial juncture, is the challenge of making laws to govern such a deeply personal experience.
