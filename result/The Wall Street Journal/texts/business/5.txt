Is anyone liable for the $1.5 trillion in recent crypto losses? Maybe so. After every market downturn, the class-action crowd canvasses the carnage looking for whom to blame—and then sues the pants off them. With so many stocks down 80% to 90%, such as Carvana and  Robinhood ,  the pickings are plentiful. But most public companies have smart lawyers who sprinkle protective legalese like “safe harbors” and pad their registration statements’ risk section. Most securities suits are settled, basically to pay lawyers to go away.
But this cycle had something new: crypto craziness. The Federal Trade Commission reports that 46,000 people have reported losing $1 billion in crypto to scams since January 2021. Bitcoin is down more than 50% since its 2021 peak, Ethereum is down 65%, XRP 78%. And of course, the Luna token is down from $116 on April 5 to essentially zero. Is anyone liable? Binance, FTX,  Coinbase ,  Kraken, Bitfinex and Crypto.com are some of the largest exchanges for crypto trading.
