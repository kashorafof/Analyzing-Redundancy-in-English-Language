One Friday in May 1935, 8-year-old George Weyerhaeuser was on his way home from school in Tacoma, Wash., when a stranger seized him, bundled him into a car and covered him with a blanket. The kidnapping of a great grandson of the founder of a giant forestry company made international headlines.
For a week, the police and federal agents searched for young George while his family assembled a ransom payment. At one point, he was shackled at the bottom of an underground pit. At another, he rode across the state in a car trunk. “I think I actually managed to go to sleep part of the way,” he said later in an oral history.
