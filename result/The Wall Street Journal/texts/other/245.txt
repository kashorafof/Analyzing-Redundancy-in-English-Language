Last Saturday, a founder of a prominent Manhattan architecture firm, responsible for a recent historic renovation—let’s call him Alvin Muffley—alerted me via email that I am “among selfish and foolish boomers who have little regard for the futures of your kids and grandkids.” Apparently I “lack understanding of the real threat of climate change” and stand as an obstacle to changes that must “occur if future generations are to survive.”
This weirdly impertinent email came in response to a column guilty only of discussing why a carbon tax would be better than our current climate policies, and why such a tax seemed a heavy political lift only because of the abyss of rancorous tribalism into which the climate discussion has fallen.
