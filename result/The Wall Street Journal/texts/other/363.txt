I remember when I started playing golf. And why.
Tennis was the family sport. There were eight of us kidsâ€”my two older brothers, five younger sisters, and me. The older of the brothers played No. 1 on his college tennis team. Our mother, now 92, would play into her 80s, still diving for balls. We bought cans of tennis balls by the dozens. Everyone was expected to play.
