Laura Saunders has long specialized in writing about taxes, first at Forbes and since 2009 for the Wall Street Journal. “Taxes sit squarely at the intersection of economics and politics, with consequences for everybody,” she says. When not writing about the code, she indulges her passion for literature and has published essays on Ralph Ellison, Flannery O’Connor, and Herman Melville. She earned a B.A. from Sewanee: the University of the South, and an M.A. from Columbia University. She lives with her family in New York City. Follow her at @Saunderswsj and Google+.
