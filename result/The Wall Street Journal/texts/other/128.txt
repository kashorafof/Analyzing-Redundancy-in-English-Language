Conspiracy theories demand a suspension of disbelief from their subscribers that almost always collapses under the intolerable weight of their own simple insanity. If the hearings of the congressional committee on the Jan. 6 attack achieve little else, they are a reminder of that enduring truth.
Like many viewers, I suspect, I have found the antics of the Democrats in these proceedings dispiriting. Through her instinctual hyperpartisanship, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has nearly succeeded in turning what should have been a thorough investigation of the causes of that terrible event into a show trial of her political enemies. Keeping critics off the committee and letting its proceedings be run without a word of dissent undermines its legitimacy and persuasive force. And if the past few years have taught us anything they have surely taught us that any process in which Adam Schiff is prominently involved is discredited almost by definition.
