Correction: The figures for academic spending per student for each school initially published with these rankings were incorrect. The current figures are correct. The correct figures were used in the rankings, which were not affected by this error. Also, a Best Value rank was incorrectly included for the U.S. Military Academy and U.S. Naval Academy. Because students at those schools are obligated to enter active-duty military service upon graduation, the schools aren’t considered for inclusion in the Best Value ranking.
