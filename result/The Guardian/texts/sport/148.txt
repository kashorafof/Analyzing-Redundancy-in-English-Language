Tony Siragusa, the NFL defensive tackle turned TV personality, has died at the age of 55.
The news was confirmed by Jim Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, where Siragusa spent seven of his 12 seasons in the league. Irsay said he was “heartbroken as is all of Colts Nation.”
Siragusa, nicknamed “The Goose”, weighed 330lbs during his playing career, and became a popular figure in Indianapolis due to his larger than life personality. He joined the Colts as an undrafted free agent in 1990 before joining the Baltimore Ravens in 1997, with whom he won the Super Bowl in the 2000 season.
The Goose squeezed 200 fun loving years into 55!! He was one of the most physically strongest players I have ever seen in 50 years💪🏼🏈 In Greece,they would ask 1 question at the end of one’s life; Did He Have Passion? In Tony’s case..Yes He Did!!💪🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️
Siragusa was a regular fixture on television after his retirement from football. He was a Fox Sports sideline reporter until 2015, and appeared in The Sopranos as Frankie Cortese, Tony Soprano’s bodyguard and driver. He also hosted Man Caves, a renovation show on the DIY Network.
He was married to Kathy and was the father of three children. Siragusa had 404 tackles, 22 sacks and five forced fumbles during his career.
Siragusa is the second Ravens player to have died this week. Earlier on Wednesday, the team confirmed their linebacker Jaylon Ferguson had died at the age of 26.
