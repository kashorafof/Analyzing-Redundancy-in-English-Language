Despite glorious sand beaches flecked with the white of near guaranteed breaks, surfing off the island of Tiree will never feel crowded. At the southern edge of the Inner Hebrides on an island just 12 miles wide, it’s easy to find a beach where the surf is right. Blackhouse Watersports, run by Marti and Iona, is based at Balevullin beach, but Tiree’s tiny size means you can head anywhere with ease. Lessons start at £40; blackhouse-watersports.co.uk
In 1929, inspired by newsreels from Australia, Londoner Lewis Rosenberg headed to Newquay with his homemade surfboard. Atlantic swells funnelled towards the beach by the two headlands, create good waves – and Fistral has been a surf destination ever since. Fistral Surf Club is located on the beach itself.
