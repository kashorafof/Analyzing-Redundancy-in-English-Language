Tredegar is a town in the Welsh valleys that changed the world. Its medical aid society – and local MP Nye Bevan – provided the inspiration for the NHS. Nearly 80 years later, a small group of community film-makers with a keen sense of history set up a huge network of volunteers to help the people of the area through the pandemic. Now, as the cost of living crisis hits, they ask where is the political will to learn from what groups like theirs did all over the country, and change the world again?
