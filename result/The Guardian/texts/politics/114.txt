Masafer Yatta, a rural area in the West Bank, is home to about 1,000 Palestinians. The area is under Israeli control, and the government has designated the area a military training zone calling it “Firing Zone 918” – and argue that the residents have no right to the land.
Last month, the Israeli supreme court ruled that evictions of the people living across Masafer Yatta’s several villages could go ahead. The judges argued that international laws prohibiting the forced transfers of people on occupied land did not apply, and could not supersede Israel’s domestic law.
“We wish we could live here in peace,” says Basel Adraa, a local activist who has been documenting the demolitions. “It’s really heartbreaking to keep filming these demolitions happening without having any power to stop it.” He tells Nosheen Iqbal about the violence against residents he has witnessed since the verdict.
The Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan, explains the history of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and how the court justified its decision. Hagai El-Ad, the director of the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, argues that international pressure is needed to prevent more Palestinian’s losing their land.
