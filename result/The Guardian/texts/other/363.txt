Thousands of people took part in protests across the US to decry the supreme court’s expected reversal of the landmark 1973 law that made abortion legal in America, Roe v Wade. Organisers said there were more than 380 protest events in cities – including major ones in Washington DC, New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago – to demand that the right to an abortion is not stripped away by the court, which is dominated by rightwing justices. Concerns that Roe is in jeopardy surged following the leak of a draft ruling by the nine-member court's six conservative justices that repeals constitutional protections for abortion and leaves the matter to be decided by the 50 individual states
