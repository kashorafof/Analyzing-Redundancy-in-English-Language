President braked to speak with a crowd and tipped over, saying the ‘toe cages’ on his bike got caught
Joe Biden fell off a bicycle near his Delaware beach home Saturday morning, moments after greeting reporters with a wave and a cheery “Good morning!”
The president was near the end of a bike ride with the first lady, Dr Jill Biden, near Rehoboth Beach where the couple are celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary.
The 79-year-old president, flanked by Secret Service agents, was travelling at some speed toward a turn, before he braked to speak to a crowd wishing him “Happy Father’s Day” and tipped over.
Dr Jill Biden had already made the turn and missed her husband’s fall. Biden’s unexpected dismount came after he stopped and was unable to release his bike shoes from the toe cages on the pedals.
Asked if he was OK, Biden responded: ﻿“I’m good.” Asked what caused the fall, Biden said the “toe cages” on his bike got caught.
He briefly engaged with reporters. Asked if he is satisfied with progress on gun legislation, Biden said: “In Delaware, I am. Did you see what they did in Delaware? Passed an assaults weapons ban. They did what I did years ago. But I am happy with the progress.”
Biden, wearing bright blue shoes, grey T-shirt, navy shorts and a white helmet, got back on his bike. “Alright guys, see you,” he said. ﻿
