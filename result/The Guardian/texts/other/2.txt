Very few drinks conjure Italy quite as much as Campari. Here, itâ€™s floated over a spin on the classic daiquiri
Few things are more Italian than Campari, and here it brings that familiar colour and trademark bitterness to a refreshing twist on the classic daiquiri.
Serves 1
40ml mezcal10ml pineapple juice20ml lime juice5ml sugar syrup15ml Campari, to float
Pour the first four ingredients into a cocktail shaker, add ice and shake well. Double strain into a martini glass or coupette (a chilled one, if you like), float the Campari on top and serve.
