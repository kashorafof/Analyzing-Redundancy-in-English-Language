Authorities said all aboard the flight, which had arrived from the Dominican Republic, were safe
An airplane caught fire after landing at Miami International airport on Tuesday, but authorities have said all passengers are safe. 
The fire broke out when landing gear inside the airplane collapsed during landing, NBC Miami reported. The Red Air flight had arrived from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, according to a spokesperson from the Miami-Dade aviation department.
The plane was carrying 126 people, and three were taken to a nearby hospital for minor injuries, the Associated Press reported.
Other passengers were being bussed from the plane to the terminal. Televised news images showed the plane lying on the runway apparently doused with firefightersâ€™ foam, with airport fire and other emergency vehicles nearby.
The airport was experiencing some flight delays Tuesday evening, airport officials said in a tweet, adding that passengers were instructed to check with airlines for details. The tweet said that the collapse of the front landing gear in the nose of the aircraft appeared to be the cause of the fire.
The National Transportation Safety Board posted that a team would arrive at the airport by Wednesday to investigate the fire.
