The Guardian’s Saturday magazine is looking to speak to people aged 100 and over about their secret to a long life 
There are more centenarians than ever in many countries around the world – including the UK. Around the world people are living for longer and some are doing extraordinary things. In the past few months year the Guardian has reported on an Italian woman who became her country’s third 100+ driver; a US park ranger who retired from duty at 100; a 105-year-old American athlete who broke the 100m record for her age group and an Indian woman who learned to read, aged 104.
We are looking to speak to centenarians from all over the world, or their close relatives and friends, who can share the wisdom of people in their 100s and their tips for a long, happy life for a feature in Saturday magazine.
