Roe v. Wade overturned: Pro-lifers persistence paid off
Kavanaugh’s Democratic assassins
Founding Fathers never intended U.S. to be secular or hostile to religion
Many in the sports world have questioned the morality of the players joining the deep-pocketed LIV Golf tour, but one famous golfer would do anything to get paid to play in the new league.
NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, whose attempts to fix his janky golf swing are well-known, told Pat McAfee that he would “kill a relative” in exchange for a $200 million check and a spot on the Saudi-funded LIV Golf tour. Heck, he’d do it for just $150 million. 
“I don’t judge other people. Listen, if somebody gave me $200 million, I’d kill a relative,” Barkley said on “The Pat McAfee Show.”
“I’m serious. They’re saying Phil Mickelson got $200 million, Dustin Johnson got $150 million. For $150 million, I’d kill a relative, even one I like.”

Barkley, an NBA analyst for TNT, told McAfee on Friday that he was rooting for the LIV Golf players who were also allowed to compete in the U.S. Open. 
“I want all the LIV guys on top of the leaderboard,” Barkley said. “I want to see the PGA Tour shaking in their damn boots. Listen, I’m not a religious dude, but I want chaos this weekend at the U.S. Open.”
ALRIGHT CHUCK 😂😂😂#PMSLive pic.twitter.com/XvozzrcVBu



Chuck didn’t get his way,  though, as only four LIV golfers made the cut. One of the notable names who missed the cut was Mickelson, who shot 11 over across his first two rounds. None of the four LIV golfers who made the cut — Johnson, Patrick Reed, Bryson DeChambeau and Richard Bland — finished in the top 20 at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts.
