As of Saturday, 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 12 member states that are not endemic for the virus, the UN agency said, adding it will provide further guidance and recommendations in coming days for countries on how to mitigate the spread of monkeypox.
“Available information suggests that human-to-human transmission is occurring among people in close physical contact with cases who are symptomatic”, the agency added.
Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild, and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa.
 It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through such measures as self-isolation and hygiene.
“What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world,” WHO official David Heymann, an infectious disease specialist, told Reuters.
Heymann said an international committee of experts met via video conference to look at what needed to be studied about the outbreak and communicated to the public, including whether there is any asymptomatic spread, who are at most risk, and the various routes of transmission.
He said the meeting was convened “because of the urgency of the situation”.
 The committee is not the group that would suggest declaring a public health emergency of international concern, WHO’s highest form of alert, which applies to the Covid-19 pandemic.
He said close contact was the key transmission route, as lesions typical of the disease are very infectious.
 For example, parents caring for sick children are at risk, as are health workers, which is why some countries have started inoculating teams treating monkeypox patients using vaccines for smallpox, a related virus.

Early genomic sequencing of a handful of the cases in Europe has suggested a similarity with the strain that spread in a limited fashion in Britain, Israel and Singapore in 2018.
Heymann said it was “biologically plausible” the virus had been circulating outside of the countries where it is endemic, but had not led to major outbreaks as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions.
He stressed that the monkeypox outbreak did not resemble the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic because it does not transmit as easily.
 Those who suspect they may have been exposed or who show symptoms including bumpy rash and fever, should avoid close contact with others, he said.
“There are vaccines available, but the most important message is, you can protect yourself,” he added.

The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday there have been 250 confirmed monkeypox cases and 106 further suspected cases since the first was reported on May 7 outside the countries where it usually spreads.
Moderna did not immediately respond to a request for more details on the monkeypox vaccines.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the government was in the process of releasing doses of a smallpox vaccine Jynneos, made by Bavarian Nordic A/S, for use in monkeypox cases.

Consumers should double-check their jars of Jif peanut butter amid a recall, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say.
Jif’s creamy, crunchy, natural and reduced fat peanut butters have been linked to a salmonella outbreak across 12 US states that has left 14 sick, with two people being hospitalized.
 Side effects from salmonella poisoning include fever, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
The J.
M.
 Smucker Co.
 announced a voluntary recall Friday of some Jif peanut butter products for potential salmonella contamination.
 Jars with lot codes 1274425 through 2140425 have been recalled and should be disposed, the company said.
Saudi authorities confirmed that it is taking the necessary measures to ensure that local markets are free of products with the recalled batch numbers, according to SPA.
Authorities have recommended consumers to avoid consuming them, stressing that it is following up on developments in this matter.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 11:50 PMThe UN Security Council called on Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers on Tuesday to “swiftly reverse” their policies and practices restricting the human rights of women and girls.
In a press statement approved by all 15 council members, the UN’s most powerful body expressed “deep concern” at the Taliban’s restrictions limiting girls’ access to education and women’s employment, freedom of movement and “full, equal and meaningful participation in public life.
”“These restrictions contradict the expectations of the international community and the commitments made by the Taliban to the Afghan people,” the council emphasized.
When the Taliban first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, women and girls were subject to overwhelming restrictions — no education, no participation in public life, and women were required to wear the all-encompassing burqa.
Following the Taliban ouster by US forces following the 9/11 attacks in the United States, and for the next 20 years, Afghan girls were not only enrolled in school but universities, and many women became doctors, lawyers, judges, members of parliament and owners of businesses, travelling without face coverings.
ALSO READ:After the Taliban overran the capital last August 15 as US and NATO forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years, they promised a more moderate form of Islamic rule including allowing women to continue their education and work outside the home, and initially announcing no dress code though they also vowed to impose Shariah.
But in recent weeks Taliban hard-liners have since turned back the clock to their previous harsh rule, confirming the worst fears of rights activists and further complicating Taliban dealings with an already distrustful international community.
Earlier this month, the Taliban ordered all women in public to wear head-to-toe clothing that leaves only their eyes visible.
 The decree said women should leave the home only when necessary and that male relatives would face punishment for women’s dress code violations, starting with a summons and escalating to court hearings and jail time.
The Taliban leadership has also barred girls from attending school after the sixth grade, reversing previous promises by its officials that girls of all ages would be allowed an education.
 And this week the Taliban began enforcing an order requiring all female TV news anchors in the country to cover their faces while on-air.
The Security Council statement, supported by Afghanistan’s neighbour China as well as the United States and Russia, called for the Taliban to “swiftly reverse” its actions and reiterated the council’s previous call “to adhere to their commitments to reopen schools for all female students without further delay”.
The council held emergency closed-door consultations on the Taliban’s crackdown on Afghan girls and women on May 12 at the request of Ireland and Mexico, co-chairs of its Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security.
They called the Taliban’s latest actions appalling saying they confirmed that Afghan’s rulers have “no intention of promoting, respecting or upholding the rights of women and girls, or of honouring the multiple commitments that they have made to Afghan women and to the international community in recent months.
”Britain’s UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward said before the Taliban came to power last August, 3.
6 million girls were in school, a quarter of the seats in parliament were held by women, and women comprised 20 per cent of the workforce.
 She stressed after that council meeting that women shouldn’t have to accept “a life banished to the sidelines”.
The Security Council statement also expressed “deep concern” at “the volatile situation in Afghanistan” especially continued terrorist attacks across the country targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the cultivation and trafficking of illicit drugs.
 It also called for strengthened efforts to address “the dire humanitarian and economic situation” in the country.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 7:32 AMLast updated: Tue 24 May 2022, 7:41 AMThe World Health Organization does not believe the monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa requires mass vaccinations as measures like good hygiene will help control its spread, a senior official said on Monday.
Richard Pebody, who leads the high-threat pathogen team at WHO Europe, also told Reuters in an interview that immediate supplies of vaccines and antivirals are relatively limited.
His comments came as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was in the process of releasing some Jynneos vaccine doses for use in monkeypox cases.
Germany’s government said on Monday that it was assessing options for vaccinations, while Britain has offered them to some healthcare workers.
Public health authorities in Europe and North America are investigating more than 100 suspected and confirmed cases of the viral infection in the worst outbreak of the virus outside of Africa, where it is endemic.
The primary measures to control the outbreak are contact tracing and isolation, Pebody said, noting that it is not a virus that spreads very easily, nor has it so far caused serious disease.
 The vaccines used to combat monkeypox can have some significant side-effects, he added.
ALSO READ:It is unclear what is driving the outbreak, with scientists trying to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed.
 There is no evidence the virus has mutated, a senior executive at the UN agency said separately on Monday.
Most of the confirmed cases have not been linked to travel to Africa, which suggests there may be large amounts of undetected cases, said Pebody.
 Some health authorities suspect there is some degree of community spread.
“So we’re only seeing .
.
.
 the tip of the iceberg,” he said.
Given the pace of the outbreak, and lack of clarity around what is driving it, there has been worry that large events and parties this summer could make things much worse.
“I’m not saying to people don’t have a good time, don’t go to attend these events,” Pebody said.
“It’s rather around what people do at the parties that matters.
 So it’s about good hygiene, regular hand washing - all these sorts of things will help to limit the transmission of this virus.
