Located in Dubai Festival City, the first-of-its-kind clinic, which is the size of a smart kiosk, allows patients to walk in to conduct a quick virtual consultation with the doctor.
Patients can complete their diagnosis and treatment for many common conditions, from chronic respiratory issues to ear infections, sore throats, fever, colds and flu, allergies, pink eye, nausea, constipation, asthma, bronchitis and common skin conditions, including contact dermatitis, rash, and diaper rash.
Smart Clinic, which saves time and also relieves patients from long queues, generally treats people who suffer from chronic diseases.
 However, in case of urgent treatment, the doctor can immediately call for an ambulance to shift the patient to a hospital to conduct a further diagnosis.
Dr Haidar Saeed Al Yousuf, managing director, Al-Futtaim Health, said smart clinics aim to solve the real-world problem of patients needing instant medical solutions from diagnoses and medicines, by putting the solution within their hands.
 “It’s the next radical step in the evolution of self-enabled medical technology, in a space the size of a compact kiosk,” he added.
Dr Marwan Al Mulla, CEO of Dubai Health Authority, said the authority always supports innovation in healthcare with its partners in the private sector.
 “Dubai always strives to be number one in all the fields, including healthcare.
”ALSO READ:Dr Haidar said, the doctor, who can treat patients at multiple locations, can listen to the patient’s heartbeat and also check the chest, ear and eye, skin etc.
 as they have many gadgets and tools to evaluate the patient and prescribe the medicine which can be delivered to the patient wherever he or she wants.
“Today, you just need a repeat prescription.
 You don’t want to take half a day from your busy day and wait in line just to see the doctor.
 Almost 60 to 70 per cent of the reasons that people see the doctor can be fully managed at the smart clinic,” he added.
Al-Futtaim’s HealthHub plans to open 50 smart clinics across the UAE by the end of next year in major locations such as large employers’ head offices, shopping malls and supermarkets.
“We are in the process of deploying around 10 smart clinics now and hopefully 20 smart clinics will be operational by the end of the year.
 We already have one large employer group onboard which will open a smart clinic in its head office and three different locations where it has a large number of employees.
 We are talking to a supermarket group as well to have smart clinics.
 The idea is to give good quality healthcare to as many people as possible,” he said.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Mon 23 May 2022, 6:43 PMA team of doctors at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC) has successfully performed a total thyroidectomy (removing the entire thyroid gland) on an 87-year-old patient.
The surgery poses a considerable risk for older patients as they are more likely to suffer from lung, heart and infectious complications following a thyroidectomy.
The elderly patient, Hasmik Dawood, had found it difficult to find a hospital that would treat her due to risk factors relating to her age, condition, and the critical nature of the surgery.
 She presented at SKMC with progressive symptoms of difficulty in breathing and swallowing due to her large goitre (an abnormally large thyroid gland).
 Her condition had grown to be debilitating, and when presented at SKMC, she was incapable of swallowing solid food.
Full investigations, including a neck CT scan, revealed an enlarged thyroid gland extending down into the chest with significant compression on wind and food pipes resulting in difficulty breathing and swallowing.
 Furthermore, the gland was also touching the heart and the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the heart.
Dr Mohamed Al Ali, Otolaryngology surgeon at SKMC, elaborating further on the case, said, “While the risk of a total thyroidectomy is considerably higher in the elderly, quality care and expertise in such surgeries opens this treatment avenue for such patients.
"The postoperative complications form the bulk of the risk factors, but the true risk lies in hidden underlying health conditions.
 In case of Hasmik, her cardiac assessment revealed a trial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) and atrial stenosis (narrowing of the heart valve) which impedes blood flow from the heart to the aorta.
"Following the diagnosis, the patient was immediately referred to cardiac management and the neck surgery was delayed by three weeks.
 At SKMC, we ensure that patients undergo thorough examination prior to surgery to ensure that such hidden complications are diagnosed in time.
 The key to success in this type of surgery often lies in perioperative care.
”Following a successful total thyroidectomy by the dedicated Head and Neck Surgery team in cooperation with the SKMC’s experienced cardiac anaesthesia team, Hasmik was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for three days of close monitoring.
Eight days after the operation, she was discharged and symptom free.

 Mohamed Al Ali, who agreed to operate on my mother despite her age.
 She was in a situation where breathing was extremely difficult that left us with no option but the surgery.
 Thanks to the care and life-saving treatment she received at SKMC, she is now doing well and has a new lease on life.
