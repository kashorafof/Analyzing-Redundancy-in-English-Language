On Tuesday, May 17, Donald hit another milestone - eating a Big Mac almost every day for 50 years, according to Guinness World Records.
 He missed only eight days in the last 50 years.
To celebrate the big day, Donald visited his local McDonald's in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, where he had his first bite of the burger in 1972.
The branch had a sign outside that read "Congrats Don on 50 years of Macs", and he even has his portrait hung on the wall in the outlet.
Donald's record for the most Big Mac® burgers eaten in a lifetime was first officially recognized in 1999 at 15,490.
 In August 2021, he set a new record with a total of 32,340 Big Macs burgers.
The 'burger king' has managed to keep records of each Big Mac he has ever eaten and saved all the individual burger cartons and receipts.
He also has glass cases which contain burger cartons from different periods, charting the design differences throughout the decades.
Over the years, Donald tried a couple of different burgers, but none could overpower his love for Big Mac.
"I had one Burger King Whopper in 1984 and one Topper double burger in 1984.
 There are a lot of other burger chains that I have never had the desire to try," he told Guinness.
"I'll probably be eating Big Macs every day for the rest of my life.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Thu 19 May 2022, 8:58 AMLast updated: Thu 19 May 2022, 10:46 PMA writer who penned a piece titled “How To Murder Your Husband” is on trial in the United States for killing her husband.
It is a case that has all the hallmarks of classic detective fiction — a huge insurance payout, an impecunious suspect who claims to have amnesia, a missing weapon, and surveillance footage that seems to have caught the culprit red-handed.
But for novelist Nancy Crampton Brophy, it’s not the plot of her latest book; it’s real life in an Oregon court room.
Crampton Brophy, whose “Wrong Never Felt So Right” series of novels include “The Wrong Husband” and “The Wrong Lover,” stands accused of shooting Daniel Brophy, using a gun whose now-missing barrel she bought on eBay.
Prosecutors say the 71-year-old writer was struggling to make payments on her mortgage, but kept up multiple life assurance policies that would pay out a total of $1.
4 million in the event of her husband’s demise.
“I do better with Dan alive financially than I do with Dan dead,” she said as she took the stand in Portland this week, The Oregonian newspaper reported.
“Where is the motivation I would ask you? An editor would laugh and say: ‘I think you need to work harder on this story, you have a big hole in it.
’”Prosecutor Shawn Overstreet said security camera footage had captured Crampton Brophy’s minivan outside the Oregon Culinary Institute on June 2, 2018 at almost exactly the time her chef husband was killed in one of the school’s classrooms.
“You were there at the same time that someone happens to be shooting your husband.
.
.
.
with the exact type of gun that you own and which is now mysteriously missing,” he said.
Crampton Brophy told the court she has no memory of being there, though acknowledges she must have been, insisting the CCTV images show her in the area because she was driving around getting inspiration for a story.
“This is not a man I would have shot because I had a memory issue.
 It seems to me if I had shot him, I would know every detail.
”Daniel Brophy, 63, was found dead that morning by students readying for a class.
 He had been shot twice.
Investigators say the barrel from the Glock handgun used in the slaying was purchased by the suspect on eBay.
That barrel — which would contain damning forensic clues — has never been recovered, despite an exhaustive police search.
Crampton Brophy admits having bought a Glock pistol, which she says was for her husband to protect himself when he went mushroom hunting in the woods, but says the missing barrel was purchased as part of research for an unfinished novel.
“There was a big separation between what was for writing and what was for protection,” she told the court, The Oregonian reported.
Prosecutors say Crampton Brophy, whose “How To Murder Your Husband” remains accessible online and whose books can be bought on Amazon, was facing financial ruin before her husband’s death, but continued to pay into 10 separate life insurance policies.

These include financial gain and the use of a firearm, although it notes guns are “loud, messy, require some skill.
”“But the thing I know about murder is that every one of us have it in him/her when pushed far enough,” the essay says.
The trial, which began in early April, is ongoing.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Thu 19 May 2022, 9:02 AMA Japanese man given $360,000 in Covid-19 aid by mistake has been arrested after saying he gambled away the money online, police said Thursday.
Local authorities have become increasingly desperate to get their money back from the 24-year-old, who has said he will return the cash “even if it’s going to be bit by bit”.
The blunder by authorities in the remote town of Abu and the man’s failure to pay them back has sparked outrage in Japan, with talk shows discussing the intricacies of his financial situation.
He was transferred the 46.
3-million-yen lump sum in error last month by officials who were organising cash handouts for low-income residents affected by the pandemic.
After visits, calls and letters failed to convince the man to repay the money, authorities filed a lawsuit last week in an attempt to get it back.
The man is now in custody after being arrested “on suspicion of violating computer fraud laws”, an officer at the police department of western Japan’s Yamaguchi region told AFP.
The man told police he had spent the illicit windfall at online casinos, and is suspected of moving some of the money to a different account even though he was aware of the mistake.
ALSO READ: Abu mayor Norihiko Hanada told reporters on Thursday that the arrest marks “a step towards the truth”.
“I don’t believe outright (that he used it all), and I think it’s possible (there’s money) somewhere,” he said.
Hanada’s staff are exhausted from angry calls and e-mails from the public, he added.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Fri 20 May 2022, 8:13 PMLast updated: Fri 20 May 2022, 8:15 PMStanding tall at just over two feet, Jyoti Amge has a big smile and a bigger personality to match her Guinness World Record title of being the shortest woman alive.
Hailing from Nagpur, Maharashtra, Jyoti was born on December 16, 1993, and her growth was of average stature until she reached the age of five.
 It later emerged that she has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia and would never grow beyond a certain height.
In 2009, Guinness World Records confirmed Jyoti to be the world's shortest teenager living (female) at 61.
95 cm (2 ft).
 Two years later, on her 18th birthday, Jyoti was measured again.
 She was 62.
8 cm (2 ft 0.
72 in), confirming her as the world's new shortest female living (mobile).
Now aged 28, Jyoti has retained her record for over a decade and broken a second as the world's shortest actress, after appearing in American Horror Story: Freak Show.
Here are 14 instances when our world looked enormous in contrast with Jyoti's:1.
 Holding a microphoneIn 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jyoti collaborated with the Nagpur Police department to bring about awareness.
 She reminded people to wash their hands regularly and wear facemasks when they leave home.
She helped the police communicate their message of how important it was for the public to stay at home.
2.
 With a babyStanding at just over two feet, Jyoti is shorter than an average two-year-old.
 She looks especially small when with children and babies, although she loves being around them.
3.
 Sitting on a chair with world’s shortest manIn 2010, Jyoti met Khagendra Thapa Magar, the shortest living teenager (male) at the same time Jyoti was the shortest living teenager (female).
Khagendra went on to become the shortest male living (mobile), before sadly passing away in 2020, aged 27.
4.
 Standing next to pigeonsThis encounter with pigeons occurred in 2011, when Jyoti was in Italy filming the fifth season of Lo Show Dei Record.
 From her perspective, these pigeons were rather large birds.
5.
 With her familyWhen Jyoti is with her family, she is often held or carried around so she can see the world from their point of view.
 At home she performs lot of chores and often helps with preparing meals, making hot drinks and cleaning.
Having the support of her family is a big source of Jyoti’s strength and sunny outlook, although she hasn’t always felt so positive about her condition.
6.
 Holding a can of sodaAn average 330cl canned drink is 11.
52 cm (4.
5 in) tall, but looks much larger against Jyoti's small frame.
7.
 Attending classJyoti has completed her undergraduate degree, as well as a Masters degree in English Literature.
 She has also taken acting and dance classes.
But attending college was a challenge for Jyoti.
 She needed her sister to attend college with her, in order to carry her from A to B.
 It also didn’t help that one of her classes was on the top floor and, with no lift, Jyoti needed her sister’s assistance there too.
8.
 Trying on someone's glassesIn 2010, when she was still the shortest living teenager (female), Jyoti appeared on the third series of the Japanese TV show Amazing People.
One of the hosts gave her his glasses to try on, which of course were far too big for Jyoti’s petite face.
9.
 Holding a Guinness World Records bookThis image of Jyoti holding the Guinness World Records book is from a 2012 photoshoot promoting the launch of Guinness World Records 2013.
 The book is 30.
3 cm (11.
9 in) tall, roughly half of Jyoti’s total height.
10.
 Holding a coffee cupAn average coffee cup, like the one on the counter in this image, has a height of approximately 9.
5 cm (3.
74 in).
 Jyoti would require both hands to lift a full cup of this size.
11.
 Comparing handsThis image clearly puts into perspective just how difficult it must be for Jyoti to perform everyday tasks or use things designed for average-sized hands.
12.
 Posing with Sultan KösenIn 2018, the shortest and tallest met in Egypt.
 Sultan, who is 251 cm (8 ft 2.
8 in) tall, is four times taller than Jyoti.
 Their size difference is so great that the length of Sultan’s feet is more than Jyoti’s height.
