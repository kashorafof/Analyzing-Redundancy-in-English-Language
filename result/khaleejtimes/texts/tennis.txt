“I would say the decision is kind of affecting my mentality going into grass, like I’m not 100% sure if I’m going to go there,” said Osaka after her 7-5, 6-4 loss to Amanda Anisimova in the French Open first round on Monday.
The ATP and WTA tours last week removed ranking points from Wimbledon after the All England Club banned Russian and Belarusian players in response to Russia’s conflict with Ukraine.
“I’m leaning more towards not playing given the current circumstances.
 I’m the type of player that gets motivated by seeing my ranking go up,” added the four-time major winner.
“The intention of this measure was good, but the execution is all over the place.
 I’m sure there will be a bit of back and forth with the whole point situation.
 Then I guess I’ll make my decision.
”“I feel like if I play Wimbledon without points, it’s more like an exhibition,” added Osaka, who has never got beyond the third round at the All England Club.
Wimbledon chiefs branded the move by the two tours, which threatens to reduce the sport’s most prestigious tennis tournament to the status of an exhibition event, as “disproportionate”.
Defending champion Novak Djokovic would lose 2,000 points and his world number one spot as a result.
World number one Iga Swiatek, who wore a ribbon in the colours of Ukraine for her first round win on Monday, said she was happy to still play Wimbledon, with or without points.
“I’m okay with playing without points.
 It’s Wimbledon.
 It’s one of the most important tournaments in the season,” said Swiatek.
“But it would be nice if the people who are making decisions were making decisions that are going to stop Russia’s aggression.
”The Wimbledon ban will rule out the likes of US Open champion and second-ranked Daniil Medvedev as well as former world number one and two-time Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka.
Belarusian Azarenka, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2011 and 2012, sits on the WTA’s powerful player council.
However, she refused to dive into the player ban or ranking points issue which threatens to overshadow the build-up to Wimbledon which starts on June 27.
“I think as many players there is going to be in the draw, as many opinions there will be,” said the 32-year-old when asked if players will boycott the tournament.
“From my experience on the tour, people say a lot of things, they do different.
 So I’m not going to take anybody’s word for it, and we will see what happens.
”Rafael Nadal, the champion at Wimbledon in 2008 and 2010, said he wished for a speedy conclusion to the impasse.
“I respect and understand the Wimbledon position; I understand and respect too that the ATP is protecting their members,” said the 21-time Grand Slam title winner.
“Hopefully ATP and Wimbledon can be together and sit together and negotiate a better future for both sides.
 The ATP board made a decision.
 We need to accept that decision.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 5:54 PMThe French Open is being overshadowed by the controversy sparked by the decision of Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from next month’s grass court Grand Slam.
So Wimbledon, the most prestigious of all Grand Slams which starts only on June 27, is in the eye of the storm following the decision from ATP and WTA, the governing bodies for men’s and women’s tennis, to take a strong action against the grass court event for banning Russian and Belarusian players from this year’s tournament.
No ranking pointsThis crisis could prompt some players to skip the event after the ATP and WTA tours stripped Wimbledon of ranking points.
Wimbledon banned players from Russia and Belarus in response to Russia’s conflict with Ukraine even though they are allowed to continue competing at other tournaments, including the ongoing French Open.
“In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players,” the All England Club said.
It is not the first time that the tournament has instituted a ban — players from Germany and Japan were prevented from competing in the immediate aftermath of World War II.
The ATP and WTA, who run the professional tours, responded by stripping the event of ranking points.
“The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour.
 The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system.
 It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement.
 Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022,” ATP said in a statement.
Osaka not playing WimbledonFormer world number one Naomi Osaka said she is considering not playing Wimbledon if there are no ranking points.
“I’m leaning more towards not playing given the current circumstances.
 I’m the type of player that gets motivated by seeing my ranking go up,” said the four-time major winner.
Djokovic ‘intends to go’Defending champion Novak Djokovic “intends to go” although he insisted on Monday that the decision to ban players was a “mistake” and that other options were available.
 He says the impasse is a “lose-lose situation”.
Djokovic will attempt to win a seventh title at Wimbledon even though he stands to lose the 2,000 points he claimed in 2021.
 Ironically, Daniil Medvedev, one of the banned Russians, could inherit his top ranking as a result.
Rafa seeks unity among playersRafael Nadal, the 21-time Grand Slam champion, deplored that players could not speak with one voice in the matter.
“The problem with the players’ side is always the same.
 From the tournament side, there is always a person and a board, a person or a board who make decisions,” the Spaniard told reporters.
“And the rest of the people running the event follow that position.
 In our tour, every single player has a different opinion, and that’s why we never achieve the things that we could achieve if we would be together.
”Exhibition tournamentOsaka said that without ranking points, Wimbledon would resemble an “exhibition” tournament, but the prospects of a large-scale snubbing of Wimbledon are unlikely.
The allure of prize money for the lower-ranked players in particular will be too tempting — in 2021, first round losers pocketed $60,300 each.
However, if there was a boycott of the All England Club, it would not be the first.
 In 1973, Yugoslavia’s Niki Pilic had been suspended by his national federation for refusing to play a Davis Cup tie, a move supported by the international body.
The ban ruled Pilic out of Wimbledon so the recently-created ATP ordered players not to compete at Wimbledon unless the suspension was lifted.
 Over 80 players opted not to appear.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Mon 23 May 2022, 8:59 PMRafael Nadal showed no signs of pain as the 13-time French Open champion marched into the second round at Roland Garros with clinical 6-2 6-2 6-2 demolition of Australian Jordan Thompson on Monday.
The Spaniard, who had never arrived in Paris as unprepared as this year after a rib injury and a chronic foot problem hampered the build-up to his beloved Grand Slam tournament, was never bothered on a chilly court Philippe Chatrier.
“It’s incredible for me to play here again on Chatrier.
 I’m happy with this win.
 First round is always special,” said Nadal.
The 35-year-old, who has a record 21 men’s Grand Slam titles to his name, played down the chances of adding to his tally but his display was reminiscent of those of previous years.
Nadal broke for 2-1 with a backhand volley winner and his massive forehand helped him quickly move 4-1 up against an overwhelmed opponent.
The fifth seed looked to finish off some points quickly and made several unusual unforced errors, but they were of little consequence as he breezed through the opening set.
Nadal broke serve in the first game of the second set and again in the fifth and seventh as he started to play more neatly, bagging it with a service winner.
Thompson, who pulled a break back, looked completely worn out by then but managed to hold it together until 2-2, when Nadal broke with a forehand volley and won all the rest of the games.
