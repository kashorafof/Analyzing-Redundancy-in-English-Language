Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 5:42 PMLast updated: Tue 24 May 2022, 5:45 PMCalvin Cheng, a former Parliamentarian from Singapore, investor, and entrepreneur, has formed the first regulated non-fungible token (NFT) and fan token investment company in Dubai.
Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) — the world’s first specialised regulator for virtual assets such as cryptocurrency that was established in March this year — has granted the company a provisional licence to operate under full regulatory supervision alongside Binance, FTX, Crypto.
com and Bybit.
Cheng, who was named as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, in 2009, will invest in projects to integrate crypto into fashion, media, and entertainment via Calvin Cheng Web3 Holdings FZE.
The Singaporean weighed in on his decision to invest in virtual assets in Dubai instead of his native Singapore during an exclusive interaction with .
“I believe that actions speak louder than words.
 For the last few years, Singapore garnered a reputation to be ‘crypto-friendly’ and many crypto firms moved there.
 In the meantime, the Monetary Authority of Singapore dragged their feet, and when they finally acted, they showed themselves to be overly conservative and the big crypto companies like Binance decided to leave.
 Dubai, on the other hand, showed itself to be progressive and open-minded, and quickly attracted and licenced four of the largest crypto exchanges —  Binance, FTX, Crypto.
com and Bybit.
 NFTs will eventually be regulated, and it was better for me to get ahead of the curve with a progressive and innovative regulator in Dubai such as VARA,” Cheng said.
However, he refused to divulge how long the VARA took to grant his company a provisional licence.
 “This is confidential and classified information.
 I found VARA to be efficient, open-minded, and flexible, which is what a regulator should be when facing a new, disruptive industry,” he added.
Cheng elaborated on the role of his holding company.
 “I believe that the next evolution of digital assets/metaverse is mass adoption.
 It’s only when digital assets and currencies are understood by a wider audience, that they can enter the mainstream.
 This mirrors the evolution of the internet.
 For instance, in the mid 1990s, traditional businesses dismissed the internet as a fad, and the early adopters were mostly geeks and enthusiasts.
 It was only when internet businesses made themselves relevant to a lay person that there was more adoption.
 Besides, it’s the innovation of social media platforms which have led to mass adoption,” he said.
Cheng said NFTs are to Web 3.
0, what social media platforms are to Web 2.

“It’s something that an average person understands and can drive mass adoption.
 Everyone understands what a collectible is.
 Everyone understands what a membership, or a ticket is.
 It’s through the world of arts, fashion, sports, media, and entertainment that NFTs lend themselves most readily to,” Cheng said.
He is convinced that NFTs would drive Web 3.
“I’ve had deep experience in media and entertainment and have vast networks there.
 My projects will leverage off these companies that I already own, or have relationships with, and take them into Web 3.

“First, I’m a shareholder of Amber Lounge, the premier pop-up VIP post party for Formula-1 (F-1).
  We’re launching an Amber Lounge NFT membership called Amber X which allows our members and community even more exclusive access to our events.
 This follows in the same vein as other projects such as Coachella launching membership NFTs, and the exclusive NFT members-only restaurant Fly Fish,” Cheng added.
What about the funding?“We were in the process of raising up to $20 (Dh73.
46) million in NFT sales later this month, but the crypto currency crash has led us to introspect,” he said.
“Second, I’m still invested in artists and influencer management agencies across the world.
 I will be bringing all the followers of our celebrities and influencers into one community and issuing NFTs to access a web 3.
0 fan club.
 In India alone, we’re confident of an initial community of 100 million followers, and these NFTs will allow influencers to monetise their followers more effectively.
 It will also allow fans and followers to interact better with the celebrities they follow and get exclusive access and content.
 Fan tokens will be eventually issued to this community, which will allow fans to show their support more effectively, and for the influencers to monetise their popularity better.
 Instagram plans to add an NFT function soon.
 This project is tentatively named Celeb X,” Cheng added.
VARA will play a central role in creating new investment opportunities in Dubai's fast-growing virtual asset industry, as the emirate moves towards safer economic freedom backed by greater technological innovation and digital transformation.
The announcement follows similar preliminary permits that enable readiness to operate under full regulatory supervision, that VARA is granting to world-leading crypto exchanges.
VARA noted, “Calvin Cheng Web3 Holdings FZE will be the first international business to actively seek regulation, despite being able to operate lawfully in many other qualifying global jurisdictions.
 Such appreciation of the need for strong governance for the sector to mature and safely scale, reflects credible intent of purpose and sound reputation of Cheng, which has supported our consideration for this company to participate in Dubai’s MVP programme.
”Dubai is the only global economy to have an independently regulated virtual assets environment under VARA.
 The emirate’s virtual asset’s ecosystem is governed by comprehensive legislation and internationally applicable policy frameworks.
 Designed as the world’s first participatory-governance model, where industry innovators and market shapers share responsibility with policy makers to create a more democratic and borderless economy.
VARA is structured to increase collaboration and innovation, without compromising public protection.
 Under the VARA regime, all business services will be subject to thorough regulatory oversight, and end-to-end mandatory Financial Action Task Force (FATF) compliance controls.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 6:09 PMLast updated: Tue 24 May 2022, 10:11 PMBusinesses in the UAE are at the doorstep of Corporate Tax.
 Only one year to go for the effective date, that is June 1, 2023.
 The MoF released a Public Consultation Document (PCD) to collect and appraise the responses of stakeholders.
 On review of PCD, businesses required clarity on certain aspects like, implications on MNEs, services rendered by free zone persons, purchase/sale transactions between group companies in the free zones and mainland, etc.
, for which the representation has been submitted by professionals and business communities in the UAE.
Since there is only one year left for applicability of the CT provisions, the businesses should start to evaluate the potential implications of CT by conducting internal assessment of their ownership structure, business activity, transactions with free zone persons, applicability of Transfer Pricing (TP) etc.
Businesses in the UAE need to take actions before the effective date and they can be categorised into three main segments:Accounting and audits:Apart from maintenance of audited financial statements as per internationally accepted accounting standards, businesses will have to review transaction with / payments made to related / connected party, (eg.
 group company, directors, partners, etc.
) as the same must be as arms’s length and wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business.
 Also, entrainment expenditure and interest expenditure will have to be looked into, as limitation has been set for its allowability.
 In general, expenditure will be allowed only if it is incurred for the purpose of earning taxable income.
 Any expenditure which is incurred for the purpose of earning exempt income or which is not for the purpose of business would be disallowed.
 Thus, updating Financials would become critical as the same set of financials  will be carried forward (without restatement) when the CT becomes effective.
Organisation and resources:Businesses will be required to review the ownership structure, check on impact of forming a Tax Group and review of their activities in free zone and mainland.
 Restructuring may be required when the activities of free zone are connected partially to mainland and partially overseas.
 Also, business will have to review if they have adequate resources (skilled staff, accounting software, MIS systems, etc.
) to ensure compliance with the CT regulations.
 Whether any change in the accounting or reporting process would be required and the risk of non-compliance due to lack of process should be evaluated.
Implications on international Business:With the introduction of CT in UAE, credit on taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction would allowed.
 Also, PCD clarifies that there would not be any withholding taxes at present, however, the possibility of levy withholding taxes in the future has been indicated.
 This is due to the UAE’s commitment to execute provisions of OECD Pillar Two.
 Entities (MNEs) which are likely to be subject to Pillar Two may also keep a close eye on the developments in this regard, as it may change its tax liability in the UAE.
To understand the nitty-gritties and nuances of the recently released PCD, Emirates Chartered Accountants Group (ECAG) released the ‘CT HANDBOOK’ during the event conducted by ICAI Dubai Chapter, on UAE CT.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 7:40 PMFinancial inclusion remains the first step towards personal and business wellbeing and is a pre-requisite to meet several goals under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.
 Despite this, over half the world is yet to gain equitable access to finance and this remains one of the biggest challenges facing the world today.
The World Economic Forum, which is driving forward the agenda of stakeholder capitalism, has consistently focused on financial inclusion and the role it plays in helping communities thrive.
This all-important topic was a subject of discussion on the second day of the ongoing WEF at Davos, with several global stakeholders convening to discuss this issue.
Queen Máxima of the Netherlands opened the session raising a question on the need for public and private stakeholders to fully understand the purpose of financial inclusion and evaluate how it can result in better financial health of an individual.
Karabo Morule of Capital Art, South Africa, brought up the subject of financial literacy as a key element of driving better use of access to finance.
 Her call for financial literacy finds relevance in various research studies which show a significant correlation between financial inclusion and financial education.
 In fact, developing countries today report a financial literacy level of as low as 30 per cent compared to the average of 60 per cent in developed economies.
Against this background, Morule spoke of how financial literacy would encourage people to invest in insurance, especially among the underprivileged and marginal groups.
Her thoughts on connecting the underprivileged with prudent products was echoed by Adeeb, whose company, LuLu Financial Holdings, is involved in the cross-border remittances and micro-loans segment.
 With over 1.
1 billion people worldwide locked out of formal financial channels due to lack of a verifiable identity, Adeeb took the examples of India’s Aadhar scheme and UAE’s Wage Protection Scheme to drive home the need for better traceability of consumer spending.
According to him, this is important to complement awareness about products suited to the needs of the under-served.
 Adeeb also suggested that while digitization has its inherent benefits, financial institutions should remember the emotional aspect at the grassroots level and accordingly bring in a personalized touch to their services to ensure last-mile consumers are onboarded efficiently.
Gelsomina Vigliotti of the European Investment Bank, which works with several developing economies on grassroots level projects, further mentioned that access to finance should come with adequate skill training & development so that the money is utilised properly.
 Merely gaining financial access doesn’t guarantee growth but having a strong business case to deploy it makes the difference, she added.
Andre Soelistyo of GoTo Indonesia asked for greater public-private involvement to drive down the cost of moving money to zero.
 According to him, this is necessary to build sustainable solutions that can get people to utilise financial products suited to their wellbeing.
 He spoke of how his company was able to leverage the potential of digital solutions during the pandemic to onboard millions of motorbike riders in Indonesia, thereby giving them access to the market opportunity.
Central to this point of digitization, the conversation also touched upon various aspects of cyber fraud, especially with digital newbies having little awareness of the security involved.
 Globally, cybercrime is up by 600 per cent as more people move online, with 67 per cent of financial institutions reporting an increase in cyber-attacks over the past year.
Against this backdrop, François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, admitted that while this is a concern, there should not be a trade-off between digitisation and regulation in the march towards greater financial inclusion.
 He expected stakeholders to work together so that both grow in tandem with the demand.
He was also vocal about the need to bring in gamification elements into financial literacy campaigns, suggesting strongly that financial literacy cannot be done in isolation.
The conversation, which was moderated by Faisal Islam, Economic Editor of BBC, also touched upon several successful case studies from developing economies such as the UAE, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and South Africa among others.

Wednesday, May 25, 2022 | Shawwal 24, 1443Published: Tue 24 May 2022, 6:22 PMHis Highness Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, on Tuesday inaugurated the Sharjah Waste to Energy plant, the first-of-its-kind project in the Middle East.
The plant, announced in 2018, will divert up to 300,000 tonnes of waste from landfills annually, supporting the achievement of the UAE’s goals for waste diversion and management.
 It is the first project of Emirates Waste to Energy, a joint venture established by Bee’ah Energy and Masdar.
The project will contribute to avoiding the emission of up to 450,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, which supports the country’s efforts to implement the strategic initiative to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
 It will produce 30 megawatts of low-carbon electricity, enough to supply electricity to about 28,000 homes in the UAE, and provide 45 million cubic meters of natural gas each year.
Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of Sharjah; Sheikh Abdullah bin Salem bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah; Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah, also attended the ceremony.
Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Chairman of Masdar; Salim bin Mohammed Al Owais, Chairman of Bee’ah Group; Masdar chief executive officer (CEO) Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi; Bee’ah Group CEO Khaled Al Huraimel, and other industry and government leaders were also present on the occasion.
A landmark achievementDr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber said the deployment of the first commercial scale waste to energy plant in the Middle East represents a landmark achievement in the UAE’s sustainable economic growth trajectory.
“By turning waste into energy, this new plant exemplifies the economic benefits of sustainable en-ergy production and a low carbon development pathway.
  The use of this technology reduces waste and landfill use, creates valuable low carbon energy and introduces a new sustainable industry to our region,” he said.
“Today’s event marks a key milestone in the UAE’s sustainable development and demonstrates the economic impact of the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative.
 This is the type of practical in-novation that the UAE is keen to promote along with domestic and international partners in sup-port of commercially viable climate solutions, in particular as the nation prepares to host COP 28 next year,” he said.
Low-carbon electricityKhaled Al Huraimel delivered a speech in which he thanked the Ruler of Sharjah for his continuous support for Bee’ah and its continuous efforts in implementing the emirate’s vision, which contributed to the completion of the Sharjah waste-to-energy plant.
“By enabling 100 per cent landfill waste diversion in Sharjah and contributing to low-carbon electricity in the UAE, this partnership highlights the clean-energy opportunity in tackling the challenge of unrecyclable waste,” he said.
Mohammed Hassan Khalaf, director-general of the Sharjah Broadcasting Authority, gave a presentation on the achievements of Bee’ah, the Sharjah Waste to Energy plant.
Bee’ah Group has achieved a qualitative achievement in the Emirate of Sharjah by raising the diversion of waste away from landfills at a rate of 76 per cent, the highest in the Middle East, with the support of various recycling facilities that receive various types of waste.
“With the waste-to-energy plant entering the actual operation phase, we will be able to completely treat non-recyclable waste, thus raising the rate of waste diversion in the Emirate of Sharjah away from landfills to one hundred percent,” he added.
The Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikhs and attendees watched a presentation on the stages of establishing the Sharjah Waste to Energy plant, its most prominent objectives, facilities and expected operating results.
HOW IT WORKSThe plant works by processing unrecyclable waste at high temperatures and the resulting heat is recovered by a boiler.
 The boiler then produces steam, which drives a turbine to produce electricity.
 Bottom ash produced during the process is collected for recovery of metals and ash material, which can be used in construction and roadwork applications.
 Fly ash is also collected and treated separately.
The plant covers an 80,000 sqm area and is adjacent to the integrated waste management complex operated by Bee’ah Recycling, Bee’ah Group’s recycling and material recovery business.
 Unrecyclable waste from the waste management complex will be taken for processing at the Sharjah Waste to Energy plant.
