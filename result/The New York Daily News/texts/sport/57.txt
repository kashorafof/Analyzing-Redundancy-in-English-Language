Witness Ricky Francis, 38, said he head a loud “boom!” right before the truck and the SUV crashed through the intersection of E. 102nd St. and Glenwood Road. Both vehicles went flying onto the sidewalk, through a fence, and into a yard.
He turned around to see the aftermath, then found the FedEx driver, unconscious, under the front left wheel of her own truck.
“She was bleeding,” Francis said of the FedEx driver.

He rushed to help and called 911, and the dispatcher insisted he perform CPR until firefighters arrived a few minutes later.
Francis said the SUV and the FedEx truck were driving parallel on Glenwood, and when the truck slowed to make a left turn the SUV driver tried to overtake her on the left.
The 22-year-old man behind the wheel of the SUV and his 21-year-old passenger suffered minor injuries, cops said.
