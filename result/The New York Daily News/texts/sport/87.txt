The Florida mother of a 2-year-old boy who mistakenly shot and killed his father is facing criminal charges in connection with the accident.
Reggie Mabry was playing video games inside his Orlando home last month when one of his three children managed to get their hands on a Glock 19 and then pulled the trigger, according to an Orange County Sheriff’s Office report. The 61-year-old father was struck in the back and later died from the wound.

“The gun was not properly stored,” Orange County Sheriff John Mina told reporters at a news conference. “In fact, it was easily accessible, even to a 2-year-old, and the result is a tragedy that no one in this community can really comprehend.”
How exactly the child came to possess the firearm remained unclear on Tuesday, police said.
On Monday, Marby’s wife and the mother of his children, Marie Ayala, was arrested and charged with with manslaughter by culpable negligence, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of ammunition by a convicted felon and violation of probation, Mina said.
Both Marby and Ayla had been on probation for child neglect and narcotics possession. Mina emphasized that as convicted felons, they are not allowed to own or possess firearms.
None of the children at the home were injured in the gunfire. They have since been placed in the care of Florida Department of Children and Families.
“Now these young children have effectively lost both of their parents,” Mina said. “And a young child has to live his life knowing he shot his father.”
