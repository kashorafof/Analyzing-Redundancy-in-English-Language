There was mayhem outside the Magic Kingdom on Sunday when the Angels and Mariners had a benches-clearing throw down in Anaheim.
The fun started in the second inning when Seattleâ€™s Jesse Winker was plunked on the inningâ€™s first pitch by Andrew Wantz.

The game was delayed 18 minutes and the brawl led to the ejections of Angels manager Phil Nevin, the Marinersâ€™ manager, Scott Servais, as well as players Jesse Winker, JP Crawford, Julio Rodriguez, the Angelsâ€™ Raisel Iglesias, Andrew Wantz, and Ryan Tepera.
The rest of the game occurred without incident and the Angels won, 2-1.
