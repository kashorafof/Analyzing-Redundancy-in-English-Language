A hit-and-run driver plowed into a 12-year-old girl as she crossed a Bronx street in a brutal caught-on-video crash, cops said Wednesday.
The pre-teen was crossing Boone Ave. near E. 174th St. in East Morrisania about 4:25 p.m., rushing to embrace a friend, when a dark BMW sedan barreled into her.
Video shows the girl roll over the hood and roof of the car as the driver kept going for several feet.
The driver then zipped off, leaving the girl with cuts and bruises all over her body, cops said. She survived the impact, and was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition.
Cops ask anyone with information about the driver to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
