A trio of killers gunned down a man in broad daylight outside a Bronx apartment building Wednesday, cops said.
The 29-year-old victim was standing in front of a building on Walton Ave. near E. 183rd St. in Fordham Heights just before 11:30 a.m., when three men got out of a vehicle, walked toward him and shot him in the head, cops said.

Cops have not yet released the victim’s name, and police have made no arrests in the slaying.
