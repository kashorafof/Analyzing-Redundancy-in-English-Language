A Brooklyn man has been slapped with a hate crime charge after he took a swing at an orthodox Jewish man and threatened to “get rid of all you Jews,” police said Sunday.
A hate-filled brute accosted a Jewish man on a Brooklyn street, threatening to “Get rid of all you Jews." The attack was the latest in a growing trend of anti-Semitic hate crimes erupting in the city.
The 18-year-old victim was on Park Ave. near Spencer St. in Bedford Stuyvesant about 6:15 a.m. on Thursday, May 26, 2022, when the bald suspect walked up to him. “Am going to get rid of all you Jews,” the stranger muttered as he took a swing at his younger victim, but missed. Outraged, the suspect shoved his victim to the ground and stormed off. (NYPD / DCPI)
Orlando Cruz, 60, randomly approached the 18-year-old victim on Park Ave. near Spencer St. in Bedford-Stuyvesant May 26, cops said.
Cruz allegedly muttered he was “going to get rid of all you Jews” before he attempted to hit the man, but missed.
Cruz was arrested and charged with assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment.
He lives about a mile from where he accosted the man, cops said.
