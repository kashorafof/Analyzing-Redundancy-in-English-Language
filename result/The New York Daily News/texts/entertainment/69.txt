Mr. Saturday Night had a great Sunday night at the Tony Awards.
Billy Crystal, who is starring on Broadway in a stage adaptation of the 1992 movie “Mr. Saturday Night,” danced his way into the audience as he regaled Radio City Music Hall with a Yiddish scat sing-along.

On his trip into the theater’s front rows, Crystal, 74, thrust his microphone in front of Samuel L. Jackson and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who burst out laughing.
