Brad Johnson, the actor best known for playing the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads, died earlier this year. He was 62.
Johnson died from COVID-19 complications on Feb. 18, but his death wasn’t widely reported until this week.
“Brad was a true renaissance man,” his family wrote in an online obituary. “He was not only interested in all life had to offer, but was gifted in it as well.”
In addition to his time as the Marlboro Man, Johnson was an actor in the 1989 Steven Spielberg film “Always” and had a recurring role on “Melrose Place.”
Born Oct. 24, 1959, in Tucson, Ariz., Johnson was a rodeo man from a young age. He started his professional career in 1984, and his rugged good looks led to his discovery by a talent scout.
His first role, fittingly, was on an episode of “Dallas” in 1986. He’d go on to appear in several other shows, including “Soldier of Fortune, Inc.” and “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.”
Johnson also had a five-episode run on “Melrose Place.”

In addition to his small-screen work, Johnson appeared in “Always,” “Rough Riders” and all three “Left Behind” films on the big screen.
Johnson met his wife of 35 years, Laurie, on a rodeo trip in Dallas. He is survived by her and their eight children.
“As much as he loved cowboying and the outdoors, Brad loved nothing more than his family,” his obituary read. “He put them before himself in every way and they know that they could not have been blessed with a better husband and father.”
