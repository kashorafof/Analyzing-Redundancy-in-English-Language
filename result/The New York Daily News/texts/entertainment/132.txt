Harry Styles canceled a concert in Copenhagen on Sunday after a shooting at a mall in the Danish capital city left three people dead.
The pop star, 28, had been scheduled to perform at the nearby Royal Arena on Sunday night as part of his “Love on Tour.”
“I’m heartbroken along with the people of Copenhagen,” Styles tweeted. “I adore this city. The people are so warm and full of love.  I’m devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting.  I’m sorry we couldn’t be together. Please look after each other.”
Three people were also critically wounded in the shooting at the Field’s shopping mall, officials say. Authorities arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the incident.

The mall is located less than a mile away from Royal Arena.
Queen Margrethe and her family called for “unity and care” after the shooting, which was the deadliest in Denmark since February 2015.
“We do not yet know the full extent of the tragedy, but it is already clear that more people have lost their lives and that even more have been injured,” the family’s statement said.
