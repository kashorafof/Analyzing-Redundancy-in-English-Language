It’s no joke: President Biden is set to appear in person on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”
Biden’s interview on the ABC program in Hollywood will take place Wednesday, marking his first in-person sit-down on a late-night show since being sworn into the Oval Office in January 2021.
Few other details have been released about Biden’s appearance, which was announced Sunday during Game 2 of the NBA Finals.
“Our very elected President @JoeBiden visits @JimmyKimmelLive Wednesday night. No malarkey,” host Jimmy Kimmel tweeted.

Biden is scheduled to appear this week with other leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles to discuss a “sustainable, resilient, and equitable future” for the Western Hemisphere, his administration says.
His appearance on “Kimmel” marks his latest crossover with the entertainment world since beginning his presidency. Last week, Biden met with the seven-member Korean-pop group BTS to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes and inclusion.
And last year, Biden welcomed pop star Olivia Rodrigo to the White House to encourage young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
