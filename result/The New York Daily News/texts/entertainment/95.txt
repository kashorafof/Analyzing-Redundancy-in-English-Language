They may have found their Material Girl.
Two-time Emmy-winning “Ozark” star Julia Garner has been offered the lead role in Universal’s upcoming Madonna biopic, to be directed by the “Material Girl” singer herself, sources familiar with the film told Variety Tuesday.
Though there were more than a dozen others competing for the part, the 28-year-old actress, also known for starring roles in “Inventing Anna” and “The Assistant,” has long been predicted to be the frontrunner, a source told the outlet.

“Midsommar” star Florence Pugh as well as “Euphoria” favorite Alexa Demie and Odessa Young were among those previously reported to be up to play the pop music icon.
The biopic, which is centered on Madonna’s beginnings and was initially announced in September 2020, won’t just see the “La Isla Bonita” singer behind the camera, but co-writing and producing as well.
“I want to convey the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a musician, a dancer — a human being, trying to make her way in this world,” Madonna said at the time, vowing that the film will put music center stage. “Music has kept me going and art has kept me alive. ... It’s essential to share the roller coaster ride of my life with my voice and vision.”
