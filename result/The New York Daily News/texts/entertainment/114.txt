A 17-year-old mother faces murder and manslaughter charges for throwing her newborn son out a fifth-floor window in the Bronx, cops said Thursday.
The teenager, whose name was not released because she is younger than 18, showed up at Lincoln Hospital on Oct. 24, admitting that she gave birth in her apartment on E. 158th St., and threw her one-day-old son out of the window, cops said.

Hospital staff called 911, and police raced to her home, where they found the baby dead in a flowerbed.
An autopsy determined in April that the baby was a victim of homicide and not a stillbirth, police said.
