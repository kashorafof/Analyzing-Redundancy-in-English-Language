He’s a one-man brand.
Gisele Bündchen shared a video of Tom Brady in their bathroom Monday as an advertisement for Brady’s new branded underwear line.
“Somebody’s got new underwear!” Gisele jokes before Brady throws up a towel to block the camera.
“What is this? Let me see. Let me see your underwear,” the 41-year-old supermodel insists. “Is that Brady Brand underwear?”
Brady, 44, launched his apparel brand earlier this year, continuing a pivot to post-career ambitions despite his continued dominance of the NFL.

The underwear line, which includes $20 boxer briefs and $15 briefs, is available beginning Thursday but already has a waitlist.
In a press release, Brady Brand described its line as “the perfect men’s underwear collection just in time for Father’s Day.”
Monday’s Instagram post led to hilarious comments from fans, including one demanding “DROP AN ONLY FANS, TOM” while another quipped, “Congrats Tom! You’re the second best underwear model in the family.”
