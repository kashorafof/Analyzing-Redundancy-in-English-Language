What’s your favorite scary movie? For one actress, at least, it won’t be “Scream 6.”
Series star Neve Campbell won’t return for next year’s “Scream 6″ after she was apparently low-balled during salary negotiations.
“Sadly I won’t be making the next ‘Scream’ film,” Campbell said in a statement to Deadline.
“As a woman I have had to work extremely hard in my career to establish my value, especially when it comes to ‘Scream’,” she said. “I felt the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I have brought to the franchise.”

The previous five films in the franchise — which each starred Campbell — have made nearly $750 million at the box office.
“It’s been a very difficult decision to move on. To all my ‘Scream’ fans, I love you. You’ve always been so incredibly supportive to me. I’m forever grateful to you and to what this franchise has given me over the past 25 years,” Campbell added.
Campbell is staying busy. She is currently on Netflix’s “The Lincoln Lawyer” and has other projects in the works, like “Twisted Metal,” according to IMDB.
The next “Scream” will hit theaters March 31, 2023. It will be directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett who directed the 2022 reboot following the death of Wes Craven, who directed the first four films in the series. Series stalwart Courtney Cox is set to reprise her role along with “Scream 4″ star Hayden Panettiere.
