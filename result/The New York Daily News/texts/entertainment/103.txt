The 75th annual Tony Awards, honoring the best and brightest from Broadway’s 2021-2022 season, have wrapped up at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. Voters spread the love around, and no single dominant production emerged.
Still, it was a banner night for a gender-tweaked version of Stephen Sondheim’s classic “Company,” which honored its source material with an elaborate set and a magnetic supporting performance from Patti LuPone, and “The Lehman Trilogy,” an ambitious retelling of the rise and fall of Lehman Brothers.
“Company” won five Tonys, including the award for best revival of a musical. It was the final production Sondheim worked on before his death at age 91.
“The Lehman Trilogy” won five Tonys, too, including the best new play honor.
Also shining bright were Michael R. Jackson’s “A Strange Loop,” (two wins) which earned the prestigious award for best new musical; and “MJ,” a jukebox about Michael Jackson, which picked up four wins.
Here is the final list of winners (bolded) selected from the field of 136 nominations.
