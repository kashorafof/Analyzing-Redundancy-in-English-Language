METHODOLOGY | The best beaches aren’t all necessarily just great places to swim. When curating this list, we considered which beaches stood out in terms of how pristine or distinctive their sand is, how clear the waters are, what kind of food and activities are available or even the kind of party scene they provide. Some of these beaches have been featured in movies, television shows and even hit songs. Others have won awards and recognition from travel publications and websites such as Travel + Leisure, National Geographic, Condé Nast Traveler and TripAdvisor. (Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock)
