Sam Hunt can’t bottle up his glee.
The “Bottle It Up” singer, 37, and wife Hannah Lee Fowler are now the happy parents of a baby girl just weeks after calling off their would-be divorce, Entertainment Tonight reports.
Hunt — who married Fowler in 2017 — was headlining the Star’s For Second Harvest charity concert in Nashville Tuesday when he told fans all about daughter Lucy Lu, the couple’s first child.

“I recently had a baby girl named Lucy Lu,” said Hunt, earning applause.
While the “Body Like a Back Road” singer admitted that the music industry “has sort of hardened my heart,” he said baby Lucy “melted that all away overnight a couple of weeks ago.”
Hunt added that he’s “been filled with a lot of gratitude these past couple of weeks and I just want to say up here on The Ryman stage how grateful I am to have been a part of country music for the last 10 years.”
Fowler, who has been with Hunt since 2008, in February filed for divorce due to what her filing, as reported by TMZ, described as “inappropriate marital conduct” on the part of her husband, accusing him of “such cruel and inhuman treatment or conduct toward the spouse as renders cohabitation unsafe or improper.”
In April, Fowler requested a judge cancel the divorce proceedings.
