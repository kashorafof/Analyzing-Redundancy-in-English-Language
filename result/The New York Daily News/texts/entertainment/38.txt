At least nothing will go to waste.
Andy Cohen, on Monday’s episode of Sirius XM’s “Jeff Lewis Live,” revealed that after welcoming son Benjamin, 3, and daughter Lucy, 5 weeks, via surrogate, he still has embryos left that maybe they can someday use.
“I have a few. ... I think I have three left?” said the “Real Housewives” executive producer, 54. “You know what I’m thinking — this is crazy — but if either of them cannot have kids, maybe in 20 years they’ll defrost their sibling and raise them. Is that a weird thought?”

Though “biological siblings,” Benjamin and Lucy were born via different surrogates, Cohen told the show.
The king of Bravo in late April took to Instagram to announce Lucy’s birth to the world.
“HERE’S LUCY!!!!! ... Her big brother can’t wait to meet her!” said the “Watch What Happens Live” host, adding in a subsequent post, “Greetings from Cloud 9 #ILoveLucy.”
Cohen in February 2019 welcomed Benjamin, who later that year was featured in a People Magazine spread in which he was dubbed the “Cutest Baby Alive.”
