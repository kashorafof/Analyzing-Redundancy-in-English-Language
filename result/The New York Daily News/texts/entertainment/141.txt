A man missing since early May fell into a plastic shredder and died at the recycling facility in South Carolina where he worked with his father.
Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger revealed investigators discovered dried blood and small pieces of human remains in the heavy-duty machinery at Industrial Recovery and Recycling in Greer. They were identified as belonging to 22-year-old Duncan Alexander Burrell Gordon, who was last seen feeding the shredder as he worked the night shift on May 5.

Celvenger said the machinery involved was inspected four times since Gordon’s disappearance, including once by the missing man’s father, who worked as a supervisor at the recycling facility. During their final search attempt, which also included cadaver dogs, investigators uncovered small pieces of human fat and bone on and under a conveyor belt that feeds the shredded plastic to second machine, according to a press release obtained by The State.
“I can confirm the material is consistent with human fat, microscopically minute particles of skin and small pieces of bone,” Clevenger said
A forensic anthropologist and a forensic pathologist hired by the coroner’s office said the machine has been shut down and turned back several times and 60,000 pounds of plastic material has been processed in the weeks since Gordon vanished.
The South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office are investigating the incident.
