A 70-foot yacht called the Elusive was unable to avoid a fiery end over the week when it caught fire in a New Hampshire harbor.
The 2007 Marlow was heading toward Wentworth Marina Saturday when one of the passengers on board noticed black smoke below deck, according to the New Hampshire State Police. Within minutes, the entire boat was filled with smoke and all three passengers and two family dogs jumped overboard to escape.
Arthur Watson, 67; Diane Watson, 57, and Jarrod Tubbs, 33, were rescued by nearby boats and taken to Portsmouth Hospital, where they were treated and released.

The two dogs, who were not named by police, were also rescued.
The tide drifted the Elusive out of the harbor and eventually sank off the coast of Maine despite the work of multiple local agencies, according to officials.
A cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
