A wrongful-death lawsuit against music mogul Suge Knight has ended in a mistrial.
Knight pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter in September 2018 after he ran over Terry Carter after the two argued while discussing how Knight would get paid for the movie “Straight Outta Compton” in January 2015. He also seriously injured Cle “Bone” Sloan while driving away in a pickup truck from a Tam’s Burgers restaurant.
He was sentenced to 28 years in prison.

The suit was filed by Carter’s widow, Lillian, and daughters Crystal and Nekaya. However, the jury said last week it was unable to get to the nine vote necessary to reach a verdict. After days of deliberating and no resolution with the jury deadlocked 7-5, Compton Superior Court Judge Thomas Long declared a mistrial.
“It was so intense, someone walked by the jury room and thought a real fight had broken out. There was yelling,” an anonymous juror told Rolling Stone.

The Carter family said they planned to refile their lawsuit.
Knight cofounded Death Row Records, making stars out of rappers like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur.
