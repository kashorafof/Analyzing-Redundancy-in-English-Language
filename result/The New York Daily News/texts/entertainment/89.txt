Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett was arrested for driving under the influence Friday night after attending a music festival in Coffee County.
He was booked into the Coffee County Jail shortly after midnight on Saturday and released a few hours later after posting a $2,000 bail, local television station WKRN-TV reported.
“On Friday night after leaving the Bonnaroo Music Festival, I was stopped by the Tullahoma Police Department and subsequently arrested for DUI,” Hargett said in a statement released through his office Saturday morning.
“Driving Under the Influence is a serious matter, and I regret the circumstances that led to my arrest. I respect law enforcement and will trust the legal process as we move forward,” he added.
Hargett, a Republican, has served as the state’s secretary of state since 2009. He also served as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1996 to 2006.
He is expected to appear in court on July 14.

The Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival is a four-day annual event held on a 700-acre farm in Manchester, Tenn. This year marks the first festival since 2019, after organizers had to cancel it in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2021 due to severe weather.
Stevie Nicks, Machine Gun Kelly, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss are some of the headliners for the 2022 edition of the popular festival.
