Nearly 20 million lives were saved in one year by COVID vaccines, according to a study published Thursday.
With 4.3 billion people getting vaccinated worldwide, 19.8 million lives were saved, the study published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal said. The study focused on total estimated excess deaths throughout the world.
However, the study’s estimations did not include China due to the uncertainty around pandemic data in the country. Nearly 20% of the world’s population lives in China.

“COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally,” the researchers wrote. “However, inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for global vaccine equity and coverage.”
Because vaccines were easier to access in wealthier countries, the study estimated 12.2 million of the lives saved came in the richest nations, including 1.9 million in the U.S. and 500,000 in the U.K.
Another 600,000 lives could have been saved worldwide if the World Health Organization’s vaccine goals were met, according to the researchers.
The study only accounted for lives saved between Dec. 8, 2020 — the day the first vaccine dose was administered — and Dec. 8, 2021. That means it largely didn’t account for the omicron wave last winter.
Researchers also did not attempt to estimate political actions in a world where there was so much more death. There have been 6.3 million confirmed COVID deaths worldwide, according to the WHO, though the true death toll is believed to be much higher.
