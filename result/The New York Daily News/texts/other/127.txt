That oneâ€™s going in the end-of-year highlight reel.
Sunday nightâ€™s College World Series matchup between Notre Dame and Oklahoma got off to an incredible start when Oklahomaâ€™s Blake Robertson raced from first base into foul territory while tracking Notre Dame outfielder Ryan Coleâ€™s pop-up before making the catch and flipping into the Fighting Irishâ€™s dugout.

The Sooners are probably hoping the next 26 outs are a little less dramatic.
Oklahoma currently leads 5-0 in the top of the 6th.
