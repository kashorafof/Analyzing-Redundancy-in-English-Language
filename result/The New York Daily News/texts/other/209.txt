A man died early Saturday after showing up at a Bronx hospital with a bullet in his chest, police said.
Derek Davis, 32, got himself to Lincoln Hospital’s emergency room about 12:30 a.m. with what appeared to be a stab wound to the torso, police were told.
But when doctors examined the wound they discovered Davis had been shot, not stabbed.

Davis, who has been arrested at least once before for weapons possession, died shortly after arriving at the hospital.
Cops later determined he was shot at his home on College Ave. near E. 168th St., about a mile north of the hospital, although it wasn’t immediately clear what sparked the shooting or who had been involved.
The gunman remained at large Saturday.
Police were scouring the shooting scene collecting surveillance video that could help identify the gunman.
