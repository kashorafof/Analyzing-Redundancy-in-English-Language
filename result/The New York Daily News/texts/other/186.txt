A Honda burst into flames after a drag race sparked a collision on the Belt Parkway in Queens early Monday, and  the two women inside the burning car were able to escape with their lives, police said.
Two men in a BMW involved in the crash suffered severe head injuries and are in critical condition.
The Honda driver rear-ended the BMW on the westbound Belt Parkway near the North Conduit Ave. exit about 1:30 a.m., cops said. An Infiniti driver behind the Honda then swerved into the middle lane and hit a Subaru.

The Infiniti driver sped off while at least two of the other vehicles involved were left twisted wrecks.
The women in the Honda, both 28, appear to have escaped the car before it was fully engulfed in flames and are expected to recover. They were taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Jamaica Hospital, where they were listed in stable condition.
The 55-year-old driver of the Subaru was taken to the Brookdale University Hospital in stable condition. The critically injured men in the BMW, the 25-year-old driver and his 24-year-old passenger, were taken to Jamaica Hospital.
Police said it appears the drivers of two of the autos were drag racing. One appears to be the Infiniti driver, a police source said.
Police are still investigating; no one has been charged.
