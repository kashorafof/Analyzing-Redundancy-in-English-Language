A Kansas woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to leading an all-female military battalion in Syria on behalf of ISIS.
Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization between September 2011 and May 2019, according to the Department of Justice.
Fluke-Ekren, who went by Umm Mohammed al-Amriki and Umm Mohammed, trained more than 100 women and girls as young as 10 to use automatic firing AK-47 assault rifles, grenades and suicide belts, according to prosecutors.
In 2008, she moved to Egypt with her second husband, a member of the terrorist group Ansar al-Sharia, and stayed there until 2011 when she moved to Libya. By late 2012 or early 2013, she was living in Syria while her husband was promoted to a leadership position in ISIS to train snipers.

Witnesses told investigators that Fluke-Ekren spoke about attacking the United States, describing parking a car rigged with explosives in the parking garage of a shopping mall and remotely detonating it.
“Fluke-Ekren further said that she considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,” the DOJ said in a statement. “Fluke-Ekren would hear about external attacks taking place in countries outside the United States and would comment that she wished the attack had occurred on U.S. soil instead.”
By late 2016, Fluke-Ekren had gotten permission from ISIS to form Khatiba Nusaybah, an all-female batallion that launched in February 2017. Along with weapons training, she also allegedly tought martial arts, medical training, religious classes and how to prepare “go bags” with rifles and other supplies.
Fluke-Ekren also confessed to helping her second husband analyze documents he had stolen from the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed.
