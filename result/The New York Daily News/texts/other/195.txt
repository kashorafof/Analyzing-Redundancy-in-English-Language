A search was underway in Mississippi on Friday for a suspect wanted for fatally shooting a deputy and at least one other person in Meridian Thursday.
Meridian Police Officer Kennis Croom was killed while responding to a domestic violence incident, less than a month before his 31st birthday. His identity was initially shared by family on social media and later confirmed by Lauderdale County Coroner Clayton Cobler, WDAM reported.
According to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, a “deceased female” was also found at the same scene.
Agents late Thursday identified the suspect as 31-year-old Dante Marquez Bender. He’s believed to be driving a 2004 black Nissan Armada with a tag reading “IMANI.” Authorities warned that he may be armed and dangerous.
Gluckstadt Police Chief Wendell Watts mourned his “brother in blue,” calling the loss “especially hard.”
“Everyone in law enforcement has been on similar calls and (knows) that it can happen to them or their partner or their friend,” Watts said. “I’ve lost a lot of officers over the years that were friends and colleagues. Today brings them all back.”
Watts met Croom, at the time an officer with the Jackson Police Department and the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department, while he was head of security at Merith Health Central. They got to know each when the fallen officer worked extra jobs at the hospital, according to WDAM.
“He’s just a good guy,” Croom added..
Bender, a black male, was described as being 5′11 with dark hair and dark eyes. Police said he weighs around 299 pounds.
Anyone with information in the case is asked to call 911 or 1-855-485- TIPS (8477) or send an email to MBITIPS@dps.ms.gov. All tips are anonymous.
