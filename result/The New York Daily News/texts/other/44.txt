Two people are in custody following a shooting that killed an 11-year-old girl during a sleepover in a Detroit home, police said. 
The unidentified child was shot shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday on the Motor City’s east side, according to the Detroit News. An adult and a minor are said to be in custody.
“We don’t have a whole lot other than another child from our city being shot, this one fatally, due to some adult nonsense obviously that she has nothing to do with,” Detroit police Chief James White told reporters.

The girl’s grandmother told police someone fired into the home where the sleepover with four other children was taking place. 
The girl was pronounced dead by EMS, White said. The identity of the suspects have not been released.
News station WXYZ reports that a “wide open” police investigation is trying to determine if the shooting that killed the little girl was tied to another incident of gunfire in the area. Two adults were in the home when the girl was killed, police said.
Sandra Turner-Handy, the ninth precinct community relations council president, said Monday, “We want a higher quality of life where we feel safe, where we’re not worried about our kids being shot unnecessarily because of recklessness.”
According to The Detroit News, there have been 708 violent incidents in the ninth precinct in 2022. That’s down more than 200 incidents from the same time last year.
