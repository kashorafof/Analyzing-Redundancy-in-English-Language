President Biden took a tumble getting off his bike on Saturday, but said he was all right.
The president had just completed a ride at Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware when he fell. Secret Service agents quickly helped the 79-year-old commander-in-chief up.

“I’m good,” Biden told reporters. “I got my foot caught.”
Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, who celebrated their 45th anniversary Friday, were completing a ride near their beach home in Rehoboth Beach. The president rode over to greet a crowd of people near the bike trail. As he tried to get off the cycle, his foot got stuck in one of the pedals, and he fell on his right shoulder.

The president, who was wearing a helmet, did not need medical attention and he chatted for several minutes with the people who had come to see him ride his bike.
Biden is “fine,” the White House said in a statement.
