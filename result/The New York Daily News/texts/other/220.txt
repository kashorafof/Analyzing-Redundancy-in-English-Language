Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is reportedly not seeking former President Donald Trump’s endorsement for his reelection bid this fall as the pair jockey for position in the 2024 Republican White House sweepstakes.
DeSantis has decided not to ask for Trump’s blessing, in part because he is in a commanding position against his Democratic opponents, Politico reported Wednesday, quoting four insiders.
But the governor also wants to avoid owing any political chits to Trump as the two most famous Florida residents in GOP politics size up their options ahead of the 2024 race.

Most of Trump’s potential Republican rivals won’t run if Trump declares but DeSantis has steadfastly refused to rule out a primary run against Trump, a move that has angered Trump.
Trump told the New Yorker that he has not asked DeSantis if he plans to run for president, calling it “his prerogative.”
He did boast that he would wipe the floor with DeSantis if they wind up battling in a GOP presidential primary, a claim that most but not all polls support.
A survey of Republicans in first-primary-in-the-nation New Hampshire put DeSantis narrowly ahead of Trump by a 39%-to 37% margin.
