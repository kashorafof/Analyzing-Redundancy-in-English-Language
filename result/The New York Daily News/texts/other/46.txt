A man fatally shot as he sat in a vehicle in the Bronx came to New York from his native Jamaica because he wanted to build a better life for himself, his stunned older brother told the Daily News.
Kimar Street, 34, took odd jobs, did work in body shops, and drove a cab to succeed in his new country after moving here in 2007, his brother Damien said.

Kimar Street was sitting in a 2000 Mazda on Wilder and Cranford Aves. in Wakefield when a gunman came up and shot him about 8:40 a.m. Sunday, police said.
Street, who lived in Mount Vernon, was the youngest of seven children — one of four brothers and three sisters. His mother lives in Florida.
“He came up for a better life,” Damien Street said. “Trying to accomplish.”
His brother remembered him as the life of the party and constantly helping those in need.
“He was a happy person, always smiling, always willing to lend a hand, always helpful,” Damien Street said.

Tenny Street, Kamir’s sister-in-law, recalled his fun-loving attitude.
“He was always at his happiest with the music on,” she said. (He) loved to walk around and dance and be in good spirits.”
His family is still reeling from the shock of the slaying, and must now contend with the cost of burial arrangements and travel for his family in Jamaica and Florida, his sister-in-law said.
“(His killing) couldn’t have happened at a worse time,” she said.
Cops have made no arrests in his slaying.
