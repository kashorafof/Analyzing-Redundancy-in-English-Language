A 4-year-old boy was found Sunday, two days after he disappeared from his Montana home.
Ryker Webb, the boy, wandered off from his home in the Bull Lake area, south of Troy, around 3 p.m. on Friday, according to the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office.
He had last been seen playing with the family dog outside the home and was described as having red hair and blue eyes. An initial clothing and footwear description proved inaccurate, but it is unknown if that delayed search and rescue efforts.

A red alert was issued, encouraging residents in the area to search their own properties.
Poor weather hampered search activities for close to 48 hours, but Ryker was found Sunday in Sanders County “in good spirits and apparently healthy, although hungry, thirsty, and cold.” He was about 2.5 miles from his home and the area had experienced thunderstorms and mist while he was missing.
He was transported to a medical center for evaluation.
A number of agencies participated in the search and local organizations and businesses donated food and other supplies to searchers.
“I truly want to thank everyone who came out to help,” Lincoln County Sheriff Darren Short told the Daily Inter Lake.
