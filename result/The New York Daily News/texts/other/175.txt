A fourth suspect has been arrested for a fatal Staten Island home invasion shooting, police said Monday.
DeAndre McClellan, 24, of Summerville, N.C., was extradited back to the city on Saturday from Alabama, where he was arrested.
McClellan was charged with murder, robbery and gun possession, including possession of a machine gun, cops said.
A suspect arrested for murder earlier in the case died last month while in custody on Rikers Island, becoming the sixth inmate to die this year at the troubled facility.
Victim Tamer Shaarawy 
The victim, Tamer Shaarawy, a 38-year-old bodybuilder father of two, was shot Dec. 16 in his home on Hinton St. in Arden Heights.
Shaarawy, shot in the shoulder when he confronted the intruders, was rushed to Staten Island University Hospital but could not be saved.
Shaarawy, who posted videos of his workouts on Facebook, had two days earlier shared a photo of himself with his two young children beaming for the camera, captioned “ALL I NEED.”
A month after the slaying, Nathaniel Morton, 40, and Kaitlin Reuter, 35, were charged with murder, robbery and gun possession.

Reuter trained with Shaarawy and allegedly orchestrated the robbery, communicating with the other suspects through text messages.
In February, another suspect, Emmanuel Sullivan, 20, was busted on the same charges. On May 28, Sullivan died on Rikers Island while awaiting trial, the sixth death at the jail complex this year.
Sullivan was found dead in his bed. The cause of his death has not yet been determined.
