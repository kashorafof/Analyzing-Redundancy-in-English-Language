A portion of the Port Authority Bus Terminal was briefly evacuated Sunday night as police investigated reports of a suspicious package, police and Port Authority sources said.
Police were called to the north wing building of the terminal around 8:20 p.m., triggering disruptions in transit service, officials said. Bus service by New Jersey Transit, Greyhound and Peter Pan was suspended as police investigated, the bi-state agency tweeted.
