Mayor Adams is going ethnic — from head to toe.
Hizzoner showed up to work at City Hall wearing a guayabera shirt and insisted the untucked-in Caribbean top was not just a sign that summer casual Fridays are a thing.

Adams said the shirt is a visible symbol of his determination to represent all the city’s diverse ethnic groups.
“When I rock their clothing, I say I’m gonna rock for you as a mayor,” Adams said.
Unlike his more snoozy predecessors, Adams likes to show off his style and is known to try out the city’s famed nightlife.

The nattily attired mayor said New Yorkers can expect him to occasionally don traditional clothing from Egypt, Pakistan and various Asian countries.
Adams and City Council leaders were at City Hall to announce they reached a deal Friday on an annual budget of $101.1 billion — making it the largest municipal spending plan in Big Apple history.
