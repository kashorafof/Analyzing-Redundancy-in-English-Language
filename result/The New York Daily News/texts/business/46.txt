Israeli troops likely fired the bullet that killed an Al Jazeera journalist during a raid on a West Bank refugee camp in May, the State Department said Monday, adding that there was “no reason to believe” her killing was intentional.
The “extremely detailed forensics analysis” could not determine, however, who fired the headshot that killed reporter Shireen Abu Akleh, State Department spokesman Ned Price said.

“Ballistic experts determined the bullet was badly damaged, which prevented a clear conclusion” as to who fired the shot, Price said in a statement.
Investigators were reportedly granted “full access” to evidence from Israeli Defense Forces and the Palestinian Authority. They determined gunfire from an Israel Defense Forces position was “likely responsible” for Abu Akleh’s death, but “found no reason to believe that this was intentional,” the statement said.

The veteran correspondent and U.S and Palestinian citizen was well known throughout the Arab world. She was shot and killed while covering an Israeli military raid on May 11 in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian eyewitnesses, including her crew, say Israeli troops killed her and that there were no militants in the immediate vicinity.
She died wearing a bulletproof vest with “PRESS” written on it.
Abu Akleh’s family said they would seek “to hold the Israeli military and government accountable” for her death.
